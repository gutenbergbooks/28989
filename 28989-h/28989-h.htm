<h3>THE COMING OF THE STORK</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was always a puzzle to the little girl how
the stork that brought her ever reached the
lonely Dakota farm-house on a December afternoon
without her being frozen; and it was
another mystery, just as deep, how the strange
bird, which her mother said was no larger than
a blue crane, was able, on leaving, to carry her
father away with him to some family, a long,
long distance off, that needed a grown-up man
as badly as her three big brothers needed a little
sister.</div>

<p>She often tried to remember the stork, his
broad nest of pussy-willows on the chin of the
new moon, and the long trip down through the
wind and snow to the open window of the farm-house.
But though she never forgot her christening,
and could even remember things that
happened before that, her wonderful journey,
she found, had slipped entirely from her mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
But her mother and the three big brothers, ever
reminded by the stone-piled mound on the carnelian
bluff, never forgot that day:</p>

<p>An icy blizzard, carrying in its teeth the
blinding sleet that neither man nor animal could
breast, was driving fiercely across the wide
plains; and the red, frame dwelling and its
near-lying buildings of sod, which only the previous
morning had stood out bravely against
the dreary, white waste, were wrapped and almost
hidden in great banks that had been caught
up from the river heights and hurled with
piercing roars against them.</p>

<p>The storm had begun the day before, blowing
first in fitful gusts that whistled under the eaves,
sent the hay from the stacks flying through the
yard, and lifted the ends of the roof shingles
threateningly. It had gradually strengthened
to a gale toward midday, and the steady downfall
of flakes had been turned into a biting
scourge that whipped up the soft cloak from the
face of the open, treeless prairie and sent it
lashing through the frigid air. Long before
night had begun to settle down, no eye could
penetrate the scudding snow a foot beyond the
window ledges, except when a sudden stilling
of the tempest disclosed the writhing cottonwood
break to the north, and the double row
of ash saplings leading south to the blotted,
printless highway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>With darkness, the fury of the blizzard had
redoubled, and the house had rocked fearfully
as each fresh blast struck it, so that the nails
in the sheathing had snapped from time to time,
and rung in the tense atmosphere like pistol
shots. Momentary lulls&mdash;ominous breathing-spells&mdash;had
interrupted the blizzard; but they
had served only to intensify it when it broke
again. As it rose from threatening silence to
rending shrieks, the bellowing of the frightened
cattle, tied in their narrow stalls, had mingled
with it, and added to its terrors.</p>

<p>But, when another wild, sunless day had come
in, the drift-piled home had ceased to shiver
and creak or admit any sounds from without.
Hour by hour it had settled deeper and deeper
into the snow that weighted its roof and shuttered
its windows, until, shrouded and almost
effaced, it lay, at last, secure from the tempest
that swept over it and deaf to the calls from the
buried stables.</p>

<p>Down-stairs in the big, dim sitting-room, the
neighbor woman was keeping the lonely vigil
of the stork. Early the previous day, before
the storm began, and when the plains still
stretched away on all sides, a foam-covered
sea, the huge swells of which had been gripped
and frozen into quiet, the anxious husband had
mounted and started westward across the prairie.
The horse had not carried him far, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for the drifts would not bear its weight;
so, when the three big brothers, hearing his halloo,
had taken him a pair of rude skees made of
barrel staves, he had helped them free the floundering
animal, and had then gone on afoot.</p>

<p>His destination was the army post at the
reservation, and he had made swift progress toward
it. The ice-bound Vermilion did not check
him, and the sealed sloughs shortened his path.
Onward he had sped, tirelessly. In half an
hour his scarlet nubia had blended into the
black of his fur-lined coat; in an hour he was
only a speck, now in sight upon the top of a
swell, now lost in its trough. And then he had
disappeared altogether over the long, unbroken
line of the horizon.</p>

<p>That day had passed, and the night; and,
when a second day was half gone, he had not
yet returned. The farm-house, as hopeful as a
sailor's home, felt little worry, believing that he
was too good a plainsman to brave such a blizzard
foolishly, and pictured him fretting his
time away at the post, or in some hospitable
shanty nearer by.</p>

<p>But the neighbor woman was full of fear for
his safety. And, as she waited alone, she walked
to and fro, watching first the canopied bed in
the corner, and then the shaking sash that, if
Providence were merciful, might at any moment
frame an eager face. Every little while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
she paused at the stove, where, the hay twists
having long since given out, she fed the fire
from a heaping basket of yellow, husked corn.</p>

<p>The three big brothers were in the attic overhead,
huddled close about the warm stovepipe
that came up through the floor, with the dogs at
their backs. It was dusk there, too, for the
western gable window, broken the evening before
by the force of the storm, was nailed tight
from within and piled high from without;
while the window in the opposite end of the
house was intact, but veiled with frost and hung
with icicles. The week's washing, swinging
under the peaked roof on a long, sagging
clothes-line, added further to the gloom. Stiff
and specter-like, it moved gently in the currents
of air that blew down from the bare,
slanting rafters, each garment taking on a fantastic
shape of its own. Near the pipe hung the
stockings of the family, limp and steaming in
the twilight.</p>

<p>The biggest brother had been reading aloud
to the other two; but, as the light grew less, he
threw the paper-bound book aside, and they
began to talk in subdued tones. Below them,
they could hear the neighbor woman walking
back and forth, and the popping of the kernels
in the stove; behind them, the dogs slept; and
from above came faint sounds of the storm.</p>

<p>Outside, night was coming on fast&mdash;the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
night of a stormy day. The neighbor woman,
noting the increasing darkness in the sitting-room,
lighted a tall kerosene lamp and set it
on the clock-shelf near a south window. The
lower windows to the west were closed and
sightless, so no beacon could shine from them;
but she hoped that the lamp's feeble rays,
piercing the unscreened top panes of the south
window, might by chance catch the eye of the
husband were he striving to return.</p>

<p>With increasing darkness, the blizzard grew
in strength and fury. It loosened a clapboard
below the east gable, and shrieked through the
partial opening. It rattled the window, and
tore at the heavy planks on the roof that supported
the stovepipe. It blew the snow from
the cracks and whistled through them shrilly.
It caught the house in its drifts and shook it.</p>

<p>The dogs, awakened by the screeching and
clash of things, crouched in fright against their
masters. Shepherd, pointer, and Indian dogs
trembled when the wind moaned, and answered
every whine from without with another. The
St. Bernard, separating himself from the pack,
sprang at a bound to the boarded-up window
and, raising his head, uttered long, dismal
howls. The big brothers hastened to quiet him,
and spared neither foot nor fist; but the dog,
eluding them, returned again and again to the
window, and mourned with his muzzle to the
west.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while the hurricane was thus raging
over the farm-house, and when nothing but a
bit of south roof and the tops of the cottonwoods
showed that a habitation was there, that
the stork alighted.</p>

<p>The big brothers were drowsing in the dark
about the pipe, with the pack whimpering beside
them, and did not know of his coming
until, in a sudden lull, there came up through
the open trap-door that led to the sitting-room
stairs a small, clear, hailing cry.</p>

<p>It sounded but for an instant. Then the
storm broke again, the windows rattled, the
dogs whined, the sleet-charged air boomed and
thundered and sucked at the quivering house,
and darkness, ever blacker and more terrible,
settled down.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the neighbor woman came softly up
and put her head above the trap-door, she had
to call again and again into the gloom, through
which the lines of frozen clothes waved faint
and ghost-like, before the big brothers awoke
and, rising from their cramped positions,
groped their way sleepily to the stairs and
followed her down. As they reached the sitting-room
and stood in a silent, waiting row
by the stove, the dogs about them, the neighbor
woman tiptoed to the canopied bed in the corner
and took up a tiny bundle, which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
brought back and laid in the arms of the biggest
brother.</p>

<p>Then she leaned back, all fat and smiling, as
the big brothers bent over the bundle and looked
into a wee, puckered, pink face. It was the little
girl.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>A FRONTIER CHRISTENING</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE christening of the little girl began the
very morning after the stork flew down
through the blizzard and left her. For the three
big brothers, rejoicing that they were still only
three, got out the almanac, the world's atlas,
and the dictionary, went carefully through the
first two, read a long list in the back of the last,
and wrote down all the names they liked. Then
they set about trying to decide upon one.</div>

<p>It was difficult, for their selections were numerous.
The world's atlas had yielded Morena,
Lansing, and Virginia; the back of the dictionary,
a generous line beginning with Abigail and
ending with Zoraida; and the almanac, May
and June from the months, Maria and Geraldine
from the scattered jokes, and Louisa,
Fanny, and Rose from the testimonials of
ladies who had been cured of influenza, hay-fever,
and chilblains. So not only that day,
but a whole week passed away in lively discussion,
and they were no nearer a choice than
ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Their mother gave no thought to the subject
Instead, from morning till night, through the
lower western windows, now tunneled free, she
scanned the snow-sheeted, glistening prairie.
It stretched away silent, pathless, and treacherous,
smiling up so brightly that it blinded
those who crossed it; and hiding, as smilingly,
those who lay beneath the drifts that covered it.</p>

<p>But discussion over the naming never flagged
among the big brothers, for they did not yet
share her anxiety. The chores were their only
interruption; still, while they made twists for
the stove, melted snow for the thirsty stock, or
pitched hay out of the shaft that had been sunk
to the half-used stack and piled it into the covered
barn through a hole in the roof, they kept
up the debate. But with all the time and talk
given the matter, no agreement seemed possible,
until one day when the biggest brother
made a suggestion.</p>

<p>He proposed that each write a name upon a
piece of paper and place it in a hat, and that the
little girl's hand be put in among the pieces,
so that she could take hold of one. The name
on the slip she seized should be hers. So the
ballots were prepared, the neighbor woman
brought the little girl, and one tiny clinging
fist was guided into the crown. But though the
pink palm would close on a finger, it refused to
grasp a ballot; and, to show her disapproval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the scheme, the little girl held her breath
until she was purple, screwed up her face, and
began to cry lustily.</p>

<p>The big brothers, when they found that she
would not choose for herself, repaired in disgust
to the attic. But as they gathered gloomily
about the stovepipe, a second plan offered
itself to them in the shape of the dominoes,
and they began to play, with the understanding
that whoever came out winner in the end
might name the little girl.</p>

<p>The contests were exciting and raged from
dinner-time till dusk, the dogs looking on from
an outer circle and joining their barks to the
shouts of the boys. When the last game came
to a close under the swinging, smoky lantern
that lighted the room from its nail on a rafter,
the eldest brother, victorious, arose and led the
way to the sitting-room, the other two following
with the pack, and proudly proclaimed the little
girl Edith Maud.</p>

<p>But he had not counted on his mother's
wishes. For when she heard the result of the
dominoes, she overturned the whole project,
much to the delight of the vanquished, by declaring
that she did not like Edith Maud at all;
and added that the selection would be made
from the Bible when their father returned. So
the big brothers carefully hunted out every feminine
name between Genesis and Revelations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>But at the end of a fortnight they too grew
anxious, and the christening was forgotten.
No news had come from the army post, and so,
one morning, they set forth toward it with the
St. Bernard, when the warm sun was melting
the white caps of the ridges. They did not have
to go far. The dog led them unerringly to a
near-by bluff, from which they returned a sad
procession. And next day a mound rose on
the southern slope of the carnelian bluff and
was covered high with stones, to keep away the
hungry prowlers of the plains. The storm that
had ushered in the new life had robbed the
farm-house of the old.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> had opened, and the thawing prairie
lay in splotches of black and white like the hide
of a calico pony, before the family again
thought of the naming of the little girl. Then
her mother despatched the youngest brother
to the post-office, a day's ride to the east, to mail
an order to a store in a far-away city. Though
there seemed no possibility that it would soon
be decided what to call the little girl, preparations
had begun for the baptism at the sod
church on the reservation, and the order asked
for five yards of fine linen and a pair of white
kid shoes.</p>

<p>During the busy days of plowing and planting
that followed, interest in the christening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was almost lost. And when the arrival of the
linen and the shoes revived it one afternoon in
early summer, it was lost sight of again in a
rush of hoeing and herding. So it was not
until late fall, when all the crops were harvested
and the threshers had come and gone, that the
family began once more to consider it.</p>

<p>It was time that the little girl had a name of
her own, for she could trot the length of the sitting-room,
if she held on to the biggest brother's
finger, and walk, all by herself, from the
lounge to the table. Besides, she was learning
to eat with a spoon, which she pounded crossly
on the oil-cloth when she could not find her
mouth, and was teething, without any worry
to her mother, on an old soft cartridge-belt.</p>

<p>The subject reopened the night the little girl's
mother cut out the baptismal robe. And while
she tucked it in one succession of narrow rows
and began to embroider it in lacy patterns that
she had learned to do when she was a little girl
in England, the big brothers hunted up the lists
from the dictionary, atlas, almanac, and Bible,
and reviewed them. But when the autumn days
had been stitched and discussed away and winter
had come in, the family was still undecided.
What pleased one big brother did not please
another; and if two agreed, the third opposed
them. The little girl's mother was even harder
to suit than they.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon of the first birthday anniversary
two important things happened: the baptismal
robe was finished and the christening
controversy took a new turn. The big brothers,
arguing hotly, urged that if a name could be
found for every new calf and colt on the place,
the only baby in the house ought to have one.
Now, the little girl's mother always named the
animals, so, when she heard their reproof, she
promptly declared that she would christen the
little girl at once&mdash;and after an English queen.</p>

<p>The big brothers were astounded, recalling
how their American father had objected to their
having been named after English kings. But
their mother, unheeding their exclamations,
wrote down a new list, which started at Mary
Beatrice and included all the consorts she could
remember. But when the queens had been considered
from first to last, and the little girl's
mother had made up her mind fully and finally,
the house was again torn with dissension. The
eldest brother favored Elizabeth; the biggest,
Mary; and the youngest, Anne. The little girl,
happy over a big, blue glass ball with a white
sheep in the center, alone was indifferent to the
dispute, and crooned to herself contentedly
from the top of the pile of hay twists.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the wishes of the big brothers,
the christening would have been decided that
day and forever if it had not been for one circumstance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The eldest brother, protesting vigorously
against every name but Elizabeth, demanded
of the little girl's mother what she had
selected.</p>

<p>"Caroline Matilda," she said firmly.</p>

<p>The eldest brother sprang to his feet like a
flash, knocking over a bench in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Caroline Matilda!" he roared, waving his
arms&mdash;"Caroline Matilda!"</p>

<p>And the little girl, frightened at his shouting,
dropped the blue glass ball, and scurried under
the bed.</p>

<p>It was plain, therefore, that she did not like
the name her mother had chosen. So the christening
continued to disturb the farm-house. By
spring the eldest and the youngest brothers
were calling the little girl Anne, while the
mother and the biggest brother were saluting
her as Victoria.</p>

<p>Matters were still in this unsettled condition
when the army chaplain rode in from the reservation
one night late in the summer. He was
on his way to a big Sioux tepee camp, and carried
in the saddle-bags flung across his pommel
a well-worn Bible and a brace of pistols. As he
entered the sitting-room, the little girl eyed
him tremblingly, for his spurs jingled loudly
as he strode, and the leather fringe on his riding-breeches
snapped against his high boot-legs.</p>

<p>He was grieved to find the farm-house in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a state, and counseled the little girl's mother
to delay the christening no longer, suggesting
a private baptism, such as the big brothers had
had. But to no effect. She declared that a
private baptism might do very well for boys,
but that the only daughter in the family should
be named with more ceremony. The chaplain,
finding that he could not settle the question,
made it the subject of his evening prayer in the
home circle.</p>

<p>The fame of the baptismal robe and the white
kid shoes had gone far and wide over the prairie,
and they were talked of from the valley of
the Missouri to Devil's Lake, and from the
pipestone country to the reservations. So every
week of that summer the family welcomed
squatters' wives from the scattered claims
round about, and women from the northern
forts, whose eyes, strange to dainty things or
long starved of them, fed greedily on the
smooth skin of the ivory boots and the soft
folds of the dress. Shortly after the chaplain's
stay, a swarthy Polish woman, shod in buckskin,
came on a pilgrimage to the farm-house,
and the little girl's mother, eager to show her
handiwork, lifted the dress tenderly, but with
a flourish, from the pasteboard box where it
lay upon wild-rose leaves and a fragrant red
apple, and held it against the little girl with
one hand, while with the other she displayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the pretty boots. The big brothers, hurrying
from the barn-yard, crowded one another to
share in the triumph.</p>

<p>But suddenly their delight was changed to
dismay. For the little girl's mother, eager to
win more praise from the Polish woman, had
started to deck the little girl in the dress and
shoes, and had discovered that the beautiful
robe was too short and too narrow for its plump
wearer, while its sleeves left her fat wrists bare
to the elbow. And the white kid shoes would
not even go on!</p>

<p>The youngest brother started for the post-office
that afternoon to mail the shoes back to
the store in the far-away city, together with a
drawing on paper of the little girl's left foot,
showing just how large the new pair should be.
The very same day the little girl's mother began
to rip out tucks.</p>

<p>When the chaplain stopped on his return trip,
he found that the christening was still agitating
the farm-house, the big brothers having formed
a triple alliance in favor of Elizabeth, while
the little girl's mother was adhering more
warmly than ever to Victoria. So he spent the
evening in renewed argument and prayer, and
offered Catherine as a compromise. But the
little girl's mother attached no importance to
his suggestion, knowing that Catherine was the
name of his wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Before starting for the reservation in the
morning, as he sat upon his pony with the
family in a circle about him, he communicated
a notable piece of news. Some time during
June of the coming year the good bishop, who
was greatly beloved by the Indians, would visit
the post to marry the general's daughter to the
major. The wedding would take place in the
sod church, and would be followed by a sermon.</p>

<p>"And then," added the chaplain, "could
come the baptism."</p>

<p>The little girl's mother was delighted with
the idea, and decided on the spot to delay the
baptism until June. The administering of the
rite by the good bishop would give it a certain
pomp, while his presence would insure the attendance
of every woman on the plains, and
the robe and the shoes would receive due parade
and admiration.</p>

<p>The chaplain, satisfied at having accomplished
even so little for peace, cantered off, the
family looking after him. But when he reached
the reservation road he came to a sudden halt,
wheeled sharply, and raised his hands to his
face to make a funnel of them. All fell into
silence and listened for his parting admonition.</p>

<p>"Make it Catherine!" he shouted, and cantered
on.</p>

<p>When the little girl's mother thought of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
months that must pass before the baptism, she
felt sorry that she had been so hasty about
sending for the second pair of kid shoes; for
by June of the coming year the little girl's feet
would be too big for them. So the youngest
brother was again sent to the post-office, this
time with a letter that asked the store in a far-away
city to send two sizes larger than the
drawing.</p>

<p>While summer was fading into autumn, and
autumn was merging into winter again, the
naming of the little girl was not forgotten.
The subject came up every time her mother
brought out the new pair of sleeves which she
was embroidering. But it was talked over amicably,
the big brothers having relinquished all
right to a share in the selection because their
mother had at last taken an irrevocable stand
in favor of her own choice, and had intrenched
her position by a promise that they could have
that year's muskrat money. So when Christmas
morning dawned and the little girl temporarily
received her long, dignified name, together
with a beaver pelt for a cap, the big
brothers, whittling shingles into shape for the
stretching of their winter's catch, silently accepted
the decision.</p>

<p>The long, dignified name suited the little girl.
She had grown so tall that she could look over
the St. Bernard's back, and so agile that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had walked out six pairs of moccasins in as
many months. And when the new shoes arrived
and the sleeves were finished, she grew so proud
that she wanted to wear her gobelin blue apron
every day.</p>

<p>As spring opened, and the last tuck was taken
out of the robe, the big brothers put their guns
and traps away in the attic, and once more
turned to the plowing and planting of the fields.
But, in spite of the farm work, they found time
to make preparations for the approaching baptism.
They painted the light wagon, giving
the box a glossy black surface and the wheels
a coat of green, while the little girl's mother
began three suits for them, and a brand-new
dress for herself out of one she had brought
with her when the family came to the plains.
The evenings were no less busy. The mother
sewed steadily, the big brothers fixed up the
light harness, and the little girl, scorning sleep,
alternately hindered and helped them, and held
on to the ends of tugs and reins with her pudgy
hands while the big brothers greased and rubbed
and polished.</p>

<p>When the trip to the reservation was less
than a week off, the preparations for it were
redoubled, and the farm was for a time neglected.
The little girl's mother put the last
stitches on the new clothes; the big brothers,
each having firmly refused to let either of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
others try a hand at clipping him, made a journey
to the post-office to get their hair cut by
the hardware man; and the little girl wore a
despised sunbonnet, had her yellow locks put
up on rags, and went to bed every night with
clabbered milk on her face.</p>

<p>At last the great day arrived. Early in the
morning, before the rising sun flamed against
the eastern windows, an ambitious young
rooster, perched on the cultivator outside, gave
such a loud, croupy call to the farm-yard that
he awakened the little girl. She, in turn, awakened
her mother. So it was in good time that
the family, after eating a quick breakfast and
hitching the gray colts to the newly painted
wagon, climbed in and started off.</p>

<p>The little girl, sitting on the front seat between
her mother and the eldest brother, her
christening robe and the kid shoes wrapped up
carefully and clasped in her arms, swelled with
importance as the colts, resplendent in their new
harness, trotted briskly down the rows of ash
saplings in front of the house and turned the
corner into the main road. Speechless and
happy, she sat with her lips pressed tightly
together beneath the big sunbonnet that hid the
rag-wound corkscrews on her sore little head;
and when the team crossed the Vermilion and
passed the sod shanty on the bluffs, she did not
even turn her eyes from the long, straight road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that stretched westward to glance at the Swede
boy who had come out to see her go by.</p>

<p>But before the ride was half over she grew
very tired. So, after she had sleepily dropped
the shoes and the robe into the hay in the wagon-box
several times, she munched a cooky, drank
some buttermilk, and was lifted to the hind seat,
where the biggest brother held her in his arms.
When she next opened her eyes, the team was
standing in front of Officers' Row, and the colonel
and his wife were beside the wagon helping
her mother down.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, the little girl
was carried off to be dressed, though she wanted
to stay in the parlor and play with the colonel's
son; and when she was ready for the baptism,
the big brothers came in to see her as she stood
proudly upon the snowy counterpane of the
wide feather-bed, the embroidered robe sticking
out saucily over her stiff petticoats and upheld
by two sturdy, white-stockinged legs. On her
shining curls perched a big white satin bow,
while incasing each foot, and completing the
whole, was a dainty, soft kid shoe.</p>

<p>"My, you're a blossom!" gasped the biggest
brother, walking around and around her;
"an' not any of your skimpy flowers, neither;
just a whacking big white rose with a yellow
center!"</p>

<p>The white rose made no reply, for she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
upset on the fat feathers in trying to walk, had
broken the string that held the pillow-shams,
and had mussed her stiff petals. So the colonel's
wife put her on a paper spread over a
leather trunk.</p>

<p>When the two families started for the sod
church, she was carried by the admiring biggest
brother, and on each side of her walked
her mother and the colonel's wife, the others
following. She kept turning around to look at
the colonel's son as they went along, and so
did not see the church until she was close to it.</p>

<p>It made a quaint picture in the warm June
sunlight as the little procession neared it. The
rude cross surmounting the gable above its
entrance was twined with morning-glory vines
that had found their way to it after hiding the
low, thick, black walls beneath; and surrounding
the building was a fence of scantlings&mdash;built
every spring by the chaplain to keep the troop
horses and the commissary's cows from grazing
off its sides, and stolen every fall by the half-breeds
when the first frosts came&mdash;that served
as a hitching-post for raw-boned army mounts
and scraggy Indian ponies. Beyond this circle
were wagons and big, clumsy, box-topped carts
from far-lying farms, with oxen tied to their
wheels and swaying their weary necks under
heavy yokes.</p>

<p>The church still wore its wedding decorations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of cat-tails and willow-boughs when the door
swung open to admit the christening party, and
over the step that led up to the altar hung a
golden bell of heart-leaved buttercups. As the
little girl crossed the threshold, she looked on
the crowded, waiting congregation with eager,
half-frightened eyes. On each side of the aisle,
filling the rear benches, were Indians and half-breeds,
the gay government blankets of the men
and the bright calico dresses, striped shawls,
and gayer blankets of the women setting off
their wide, stolid faces; here and there among
them, in greasy breeches and flannel shirts, were
rough cattlemen and trappers; and the troop's
famous scout, the half-breed Eagle Eye, sat in
the midst of them, craning his neck to catch a
glimpse of her. Instead of the red handkerchief
that he wore about his forehead to keep
his black hair out of his eyes, he had tied, in
honor of the occasion, a strip of bleached muslin,
and under it his eyes sparkled and his teeth
gleamed as he smiled at the white papoose.</p>

<p>When the biggest brother started toward the
altar, the little girl hurriedly smoothed the
christening robe and put out the white kid shoes
so that everybody might see them. And when
they passed the frontier families and came in
line with the aristocratic army benches, her
cheeks were flushed a vivid pink, and she was
sitting proudly erect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she beheld the chaplain standing at the
step in a long, white dress. Scarcely had she
gotten over her surprise at his strange appearance,
when she saw a man join him who was
garbed even more wonderfully. His dark hair
was combed back and rested, like Eagle Eye's,
on his shoulders, and the sleeves of his robe
were wide and ruffled at the wrist. It was the
good bishop.</p>

<p>The next moment they were standing before
him, the little girl and the biggest brother at
the middle of the line and the others on each
side.</p>

<p>The chaplain raised his hand, and the white
people stood up. And after he had waved both
arms commandingly and scowled, the Indians
and the half-breeds got up, too, and slouched
against the benches while the good bishop said
a long prayer and followed it with a longer
reading. The biggest brother waited very
quietly through it all, but he shifted the little
girl from one arm to the other two or three
times.</p>

<p>When the reading was over, the little girl's
mother answered a few questions in a low voice.
As the good bishop began to pray again, the
chaplain lifted a silver vessel in his hands and
held it up solemnly. The little girl saw that it
was the colonel's fruit-dish, and that it was full
of water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked about inquiringly, but all who
were near her had their heads bent; and at the
close of the prayer, before she had time to
question, the good bishop took her into his
arms.</p>

<p>She was frightened and wriggled to get
down, not seeing the warning in her mother's
eyes. The good bishop paid no attention to her,
however, but leaned forward and spoke to the
colonel and his wife.</p>

<p>"Name this child," he said.</p>

<p>The little girl did not hear their answer, for
she was watching his hand. It was poised just
above the fruit-dish, as if he meant to plunge it
into the water.</p>

<p>She caught her breath and raised herself suddenly
in his arms. The whole church was bending
and stretching to see her, but she forgot
the staring people, and was thinking only
of her beautiful robe, the kid shoes, and the
threatening water.</p>

<p>A brief, solemn silence pervaded the waiting
church. It was broken by the good bishop's
voice; and, at the same time, his ruffled hand
sank into the fruit-dish, held lightly between
the chaplain's finger-tips, and came to the surface
wet and brimming. As she saw this, the
little girl's face turned from pink to white, and
she caught her breath again.</p>

<p>Then, just as he bent his eyes upon her and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lifted his slender fingers toward her head, the
little girl, giving a sudden scared, angry squirm,
struck the silver dish a resentful, upward blow
with one vigorous, white kid shoe.</p>

<p>The vessel bounded out of the hands of the
horrified army chaplain, overturned upon his
immaculate robe, and, empty, fell clattering to
the step at his feet. And while it spun there,
top-like, for one terrible moment, the baptismal
party, standing in front of the good bishop,
gazed in agonized, reproachful silence at the
little girl, who was looking back at them defiantly
from the shelter of the pulpit.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Later</span> when the good bishop laid damp fingers
upon her hair, she was christened. But
the family at the farm-house always declared
that she did not deserve the long, dignified
name chosen for her; and the biggest brother
as often added that, because the amount of
water has everything to do with a baptism, the
honor rightfully belonged to the dripping army
chaplain.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>"LITTLE BOY BLUE"</h3>


<div class='cap'>UP and down the oxen toiled before the
plow, licking out their tongues, as they
went along, for wisps of the sweet, new grass
which the mold-board was turning under. After
them came the biggest brother, striving with
all his might to keep the beam level and the
handles from dancing as the steel share cut the
sod into wide, thick ribbons, damp and black
on one side, on the other green and decked with
flowers. And, following the biggest brother,
trotted the little girl, who from time to time
left the cool furrow to run ahead and give the
steers a lash of the gad she carried, or hopped
to one side to keep from stepping with her bare
feet upon the fat earthworms that were rolled
out into the sunlight, where they were pounced
upon by rivaling blackbirds circling in the rear.</div>

<p>It was a cloudy morning near the end of May.
The spring work on the farm was long past, and
already the fields rippled with corn and wheat,
barley and oats, and blue-flowered flax. But
it was not yet time to begin the yearly onslaught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
against intruding weeds, so the big brothers
were busying themselves with the erection of
a sod smoke-house, which, at hog-killing time,
would receive fresh hams and sides for the winter's
curing.</p>

<p>A strip of prairie land bordering the northern
edge of the grain had been chosen to furnish
the building material because its fertile top
layer was tenaciously root-bound and free from
boulders. And while the biggest brother
plowed it up, the other two came slowly along
with the Studebaker, chopped the sods into
pieces twice as long as they were wide, and laid
them carefully on the bed of the wagon.</p>

<p>The little girl let the biggest brother hang the
gad about his neck and helped for a while with
the sod-carrying. But every time she put her
chubby arms around a slab, it broke in two;
so her brothers told her to stop. Then she
climbed to the wagon-seat and drove the horses
beside the furrows, and, later, went to the farm-yard
with a load.</p>

<p>The smoke-house was being built beside the
corn-cribs. Before any sod had been laid, the
eldest brother had marked out on the ground
with a stick a nine-foot square, and in one side
of it had left a narrow door-space where two
scantlings were driven in upright to serve as
sides of the casing. Then, with the dirt lines
as a guide, he had begun the walls, giving them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the thickness of two sods. When the little girl
rode up they were already above her head.
But she did not wait to see the load she had
accompanied bring them up to the eldest brother's
waist, for it was close upon noon and it
occurred to her that there would soon be a
table to set in the kitchen, so she hurried out of
call up the weedy path between the wheat and
the corn, to where the oxen were still lazily
drawing the plow.</p>

<p>She picked up the gad again and sent it
whisking about the black flanks of the steers.
But when she had gone up and down till three
long sods lay lapping each other like heavy
ruffles, she grew tired of following the biggest
brother and went up the carnelian bluff to the
stone pile and sat down.</p>

<p>Her mother, standing at the kitchen door,
shading her eyes with her hand, saw the fluttering
blue calico on the hillside and smiled
at it through tears. Nearly four years and a
half had passed since the rock-covered mound
had risen among the snow-drifts, yet during
all this time the little girl had never been told
its sad secret, for the family wished her to go
about the farm without fear.</p>

<p>She had often wondered, however, why, when
her mother wanted to have a good cry, she always
sat at the kitchen window that looked out
across the row of stunted apple-trees, the sorghum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
patch, and finally the corn, to where the
carnelian bluff lifted its pebbly head; and why,
whenever the big brothers saw their mother
weeping there, if it were winter, they always
coaxed her into the sitting-room, where a pile
of magazines and books, bought to divert her,
lay beside the lounge; or, if it were summer,
out into the front garden, where a low bench
stood against the house, under the lilac-bush,
facing the round and diamond-shaped beds of
scarlet verbenas, yellow marguerites, bachelor's-buttons
and pansies.</p>

<p>But, though the little girl was ignorant of
what the stone pile hid, she was, nevertheless,
thinking of mournful things as she sat there.
The Christmas before, Santa Claus had stingily
dropped but one present down the long
stovepipe that carried up the smoke from the
sitting-room stove&mdash;one present to serve as
both a holiday and a birthday remembrance;
and that had been a big, ugly crockery doll's
head with bumpy brown hair, staring blue eyes,
fat, pink cheeks, and flinty shoulders. The gift,
aided by the confidences of the Swede boy, had
almost shaken her belief in Santa Claus, whom
she had asked in a letter to give her a bought
riding-whip and a book that told more about
Robinson Crusoe. Instead, the homely head
had been left, and she felt sure (and the Swede
boy assured her) that it could only have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
picked out for her by the eldest brother. And
when, after gazing down upon her stupidly for
two or three months from the clock-shelf, it
was finally fastened, by thread run through the
holes in its shoulders, to a clumsy, jointless,
sawdust body, it had only served to remind her
more bitterly than ever of the ill fortune that
could make two great events in one small life
fall upon the selfsame day.</p>

<p>The little girl had often complained of the
stork's bringing her at Christmas-time, and had
been promised by the biggest brother that, when
they should all agree that she was very good
and deserving&mdash;because she had cheerfully done
everything she had been told&mdash;<i>she should have
her birthday changed to June</i>! But so far the
promise had never been fulfilled, for the little
girl did not hold, as they did, that the compact
included the washing of potatoes or the scraping
of the mush-kettle. Now, June was almost
at hand again, and, as she waited on the bluff
for the cow-horn to sound the call for dinner,
she wondered if the treasured change in dates
would ever be made.</p>

<p>While she was still perched upon the topmost
rock, she heard a faint shout from the
farm-yard, and looking that way, saw the eldest
brother standing on the seat of the Studebaker,
frantically waving his arms. She got
down, ran around to the western side of the hill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and called to the biggest brother on the level
prairie below her. He stopped the ox-team and
tried to understand what the eldest was saying.
But it was not made clear until the
youngest unhitched a horse from the wagon
and mounting it, still harnessed, started across
the wheat-field with the dogs in full cry before
him.</p>

<p>The herd, which before breakfast had been
driven north to the river meadows, was returning
to feed upon the young crops, and was dangerously
near the river edge of the wheat. The
cattle were grazing as they advanced, the cows
leading and the beef cattle bringing up the rear.
And when the foremost animals saw the youngest
brother cantering toward them with the
pack, they only hurried forward the faster so
as to get a taste of the forbidden grain before
they were compelled to turn tail.</p>

<p>Snapping and yelping, the dogs came down
upon them, and the herd, two hundred strong,
fled before them, with futile reaches after mouthfuls
of the wheat as they ran. But, scarcely an
hour later, when the little girl was sauntering
home behind the biggest brother and the oxen,
the cattle faced about and started slowly back
again; and, when the family was just gathering
about the dinner-table, they swarmed across
the prairie and into the fields. This time the
youngest brother not only rode out and drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them back to the meadows, but remained between
them and the farm till the biggest finished
his meal and relieved him.</p>

<p>It was plain that some one would have to stay
with the cattle throughout the rest of the day;
for, having gotten a taste of the grain, they
would return as often as they were driven
away and trample down what they did not
steal. But not one of the big brothers felt that
he could be spared from the work on the
smoke-house.</p>

<p>"Say, ma," said the eldest brother, looking
at the little girl as he got up from the dinner-table
and took his hat from the elk antlers in
the hall, "I've thought the whole thing out, and
I don't see why this youngster can't herd. She
learned to ride; now she can keep them cattle in
the meadows as well as not."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know she's too little," answered
her mother; "she'd fall off her pony if the cattle
crowded, and get stepped on."</p>

<p>"Ah, too little," he said superciliously. "All
she'd have to do is stay behind the cattle and
sick the dogs every little while."</p>

<p>The little girl's mother shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, we could put her on the pinto and
fasten her feet so's she couldn't fall off," he
persisted.</p>

<p>The mother looked down at the little girl,
still busy over her plate of bacon and eggs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, maybe she could do that," she said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm too little," expostulated the little
girl, between two bites.</p>

<p>"Little! You great big thing!" scolded the
eldest brother as he went out. "What are you
good for, anyway? Not worth your salt."</p>

<p>When he was gone around the corner of the
kitchen, the little girl left her high bench and
sat down crossly upon the door-step. "He's
always 'busing me," she complained. "When
<i>I</i> want to do anyfing, he says I'm too little;
but when <i>he</i> wants me to do anyfing he finks
I'm big enough."</p>

<p>"Now, pet lamb," said her mother, "you
don't have to herd if you don't want to. But
I think you'd be safe on the pinto, and, perhaps,
if you went the boys would all remember
their promise about your birthday."</p>

<p>The little girl, understanding what was
meant, looked up at her mother for a moment.
Then she whipped through the sitting-room to
her bed, pulled on a pair of beaded moccasins,
took her sailor hat off a nail, and started for the
smoke-house.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eldest brother went across the reservation
road to where the pinto was picketed in
the grassy swale, and brought her in, with her
blind black colt trotting at her heels. And when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
he had bridled her and girthed on the soft,
woolly pelt of a sheep, he lifted the little girl
to her back and fastened both bare ankles to
the cinch with hame-straps. Then he put the
short reins into the little girl's hands, gave the
mare a good slap on the flanks, and watched
horse, rider, and colt depart northward toward
the cattle. For it had been settled, when the
biggest brother came in, that if she would try
her best to keep the cattle in the meadows so
that the smoke-house could be finished, that
very day her birthday would be changed from
December to June.</p>

<p>As soon as the little girl reached the open
prairie, the big brothers returned to their work
on the smoke-house. And by the time that the
herd, with the pinto and the dogs behind it, was
but a collection of white and brown specks
against the green of the plains, they were so
busy that they had forgotten her. The youngest
brother lifted the sods from the wagon and
handed them to the biggest, who helped the
eldest lay them, one layer lengthwise, the next
crosswise, and always in such a way that the
middle of a slab came directly above the ends
of the ones beneath.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon, as they worked steadily,
the clouds began to mass darker across the
gray sky; and the air, warm throughout the
morning, became chill. A rain-storm seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on the way, and the big brothers hurried so as
to get the house covered before a shower came
to wash the walls. Two were left to lay the
sods, and the other set about sawing scantlings
into lengths for the framework of the hip-roof,
while their mother came out and bound straw
into flat bunches for the thatch.</p>

<p>Up in the river meadows, the little girl, secure
in her seat on the pinto, rode to and fro
along the southern edge of the herd, in front
of the lowered foreheads and tossing horns of
the cattle. Behind her came the blind black
colt, switching his tail and whinnying fretfully;
but, despite his pleading, the little girl, eager to
win the reward she had been promised, never
paused in her sentry duty. The pinto fretted,
too, for she also was hungry. But the little
girl held the short bridle-reins tight and did not
let the mare get her nose to the ground lest they
slip over her head and out of reach.</p>

<p>The dogs were stretched lazily on some soft
badger mounds not far away. The St. Bernard
was not with them, for the big brothers were
afraid that Napoleon, the white bull, would
gore him, and had chained him up at home; and
the collie was watching the sheep around the
sloughs to the south. So only the wolf-dogs,
with Luffree at their head, helped the little
girl turn an animal back when it broke from
the rest and started toward the grain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl rode faithfully before the herd,
not even stopping to join the dogs in their chase
after a kit-fox that was boldly passing among
the cattle. And when the hunt was over and the
cows went down the runway to the river, she
followed in their train, with the pinto still tugging
hard at the reins. But at the bank she
forgot how tired her arms were, for the pack
had returned and were amusing themselves by
barking and biting at the snakes that were
lying along the strip of sand, and by pursuing
them as they scattered to the water or to the
shelter of the willows at its edge. When the
herd had drunk their fill, she slowly rode eastward,
watching them carefully as they spread
out across the meadow.</p>

<p>It was then that the clouds came up and the
air turned cool. And it was then that, accidentally,
and in one unhappy moment, the little
girl brought all her faithful work to naught, imperiled
her birthday hopes, and cast herself
adrift upon the prairie like a voyager in a rudderless
boat. For, in stooping to pull the sheepskin
saddle-blanket over her bare legs, she unthinkingly
let go of the bridle, and, the pinto
putting her head down to graze, the short reins
slipped along her mane until they rested just
behind her ears&mdash;far out of reach.</p>

<p>The little girl slapped her as hard as she
could with her hands; but, even when the mare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
raised her head and walked about, the little girl
could not get at the reins because she was
tightly fastened to the girth. So the pinto went
where she pleased, paying no attention to angry
commands, or to the pounding inflicted upon
her flanks by the fists of the irate little girl.</p>

<p>All this time the herd, too, fed where it chose
and had moved out of the meadows toward the
farm. The little girl was powerless to turn it,
and when she set the pack at the cattle they only
ran faster than ever toward the fields. So she
called the dogs off. Slowly, but surely, the cows
led the forbidden way, and as the little girl
moved about on the pinto, powerless to go
where she wished or to turn them back, she
watched them, swelling with very rage in her
helplessness, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>When the herd was out of sight over the
rise south of the meadow, the pinto, with her
reluctant rider, again went riverward. This
time the mare took a good drink, wading in
so far that the little girl's anger turned to fear
and she cried harder than ever. As the horse
came out of the stream, the loud <i>yur</i>, <i>yur</i>, of a
frightened crow, whose nest was in the willow
fringe, startled the blind black colt, and he
started on a run up the river. His mother,
whinnying loudly, followed him and broke into
such a hard gallop that the little girl was
bounced rudely about and would have fallen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the ground had not the hame-straps firmly held
her.</p>

<p>Away they went, the colt in the lead and the
pinto after, until they reached the bunch of cottonwoods
far up the stream where the yanging
wild geese had their nests. Then the colt came
to a halt and waited tremblingly for his anxious
mother.</p>

<p>The black colt had a wild fear of crows, for
it was due to them that he had been blind ever
since, a few days after his birth, he had accompanied
his mother across the reservation road
to the sloughs beyond. He had trotted happily
at her side as they went, but late in the evening
had run one knobby leg into a hole in the prairie-dog
village and taken a bad tumble. He
had not been able to rise again, and, in struggling
had got wedged upon his back between
two mounds, so that he had to lie, feet up, all
night. His mother had fed near him till dark
came on, and had stood over him through the
night; and not till the sun was well up did she
leave him to go for water. It was then that
he had been blinded, for some crows, flying by
to the stubble-fields around the farm-house, had
thought him dead and had alighted beside him
with inquiring cries.</p>

<p>Now, as he stood in the cottonwoods beside
his mother, he shook his head uneasily as if unpleasant
memories were stirring in his baby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
brain, and stamped crossly as the dogs came up,
their tongues out with their hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Time dragged slowly. Late in the afternoon
a dash of rain found its way down through the
cottonwood leaves, splashed against the little
girl's face, and mingled with the tear-drops.
The pinto moved farther into the shelter of the
grove and the light sprinkle did not wet her.
As the light slowly faded the peepers along the
river began to send up their lonesome chant,
and a crow went whirring past to his home
down the river, with no cry to the blind black
colt underneath, for his bill was thrust through
a redhead's egg. Near by, from the open prairie,
the brown pippets flew skyward against the
rain-drops, greeting the coming night with a
last song, and then dropped silently to their
nests in the lush grass.</p>

<p>The framework of the smoke-house roof was
in its place, and the laying of the straw bundles,
in long, overlapping rows, well started before
the shower began; and so rapidly did the big
brothers work, that when the collie came in with
the sheep, the thatching was nearly finished,
and the squatty, straw-crowned building, with
grass and flower tops sticking, still fresh, from
between its sods, looked like one of the chocolate
layer-cakes that the little girl's mother made for
Thanksgiving, only the filling was green instead
of brown, and the top coating was gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>They were on top of the house, laying the
last two rows of straw along the ridge-pole,
when their mother, who was in the kitchen getting
supper, noticed that it was sprinkling,
looked northward through the gloom to try to
catch a glimpse of the little girl returning with
the herd, and then called to the big brothers to
ask if they could not see cattle moving about in
the corn. They looked and, from their vantage-point,
made out a big herd. Their shout
brought their mother hurrying into the yard.</p>

<p>"They're not ours, are they?" she asked.
But the big brothers were bringing the wagon
team and a cultivator horse out of the barn, unsaddled
and unbridled, and did not hear. Before
she could reach them, they had dashed off.</p>

<p>She stood looking after them, her apron over
her head. She knew that if the cattle in the
field belonged to the farm, something had gone
wrong with the little girl; and she strained her
eyes anxiously to where loud bellows, shouts,
and the cracking of cattle-gads told that the
herd was being routed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from across the intervening corn
and sorghum and into the cottonwood break,
crashed a great white <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bulk'">bull</ins>, whose curly head
was swaying angrily and whose eyes shone with
the lust of fight, while behind, laying about him
with a whip at every jump, came the biggest
brother. It was Napoleon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my poor pet lamb!" cried the little
girl's mother, and retreated into the smoke-house
for safety as the bull and his pursuer
came by.</p>

<p>It took hard riding to rid the grain of the
cattle, for, under cover of the dusk, they
slipped back into the wheat again and again
after having been driven out. So it was long
after supper-time before the herd was bunched
and driven around the farm to the reservation
road and into the wire pen by way of the ash
lane in front of the house. Then the big brothers
came tramping into the kitchen, tired and
hungry.</p>

<p>But what was their surprise to find it empty.
And, on looking about, they discovered a note
from their mother. It had been put in plain
sight against the syrup-jug and read:</p>

<p>"<i>The dogs, all except Luffree, came home. If
she has returned when you read this, fire a
musket.</i>"</p>

<p>They stood in a circle and looked blankly at
one another. For it had not crossed their minds
that the little girl was not home, but somewhere
out on the prairie, tied to a pinto, and all
alone in the dark.</p>

<p>Without waiting to snatch a bite from the
table, they started off to search, leaving their
jaded horses in the barn. The eldest brother
went straight for the river, which he meant to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
follow, and took a musket with him; the youngest
ran off up the path between the corn and the
wheat, and carried the cow-horn; while the biggest
made for the carnelian bluff, taking neither
gun nor horn, but relying on his lungs to carry
any good news to the others. And behind
them, as they hurried, sounded the baying of
the St. Bernard, ignominiously chained to a
stake by the kitchen door.</p>

<p>The evening wore on. Overhead the low-hanging
clouds covered the moonless sky like a
hood, and not a star shone through the fleecy
thickness to aid in the search for the little girl.
At a late hour it began to sprinkle again, and,
though no sound of shot or blast had broken the
silence of the prairie, one by one the anxious
hunters came straggling home, dumbly ate, and
waited for the morning.</p>

<p>The little girl's mother, sitting behind the
stove, cried heartbrokenly. "If my poor baby
ever comes back alive," she sobbed, "she shall
have her birthday in June and the best present
I can get her." And all the big brothers silently
assented.</p>

<p>But while they were gathered thus, drying
their damp clothes, the biggest brother suddenly
sprang up with a joyful cry.</p>

<p>"Why didn't we think of it before?" he said&mdash;"the
St. Bernard!"</p>

<p>A moment later he was freeing the big dog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and his mother, lantern in hand, was holding a
little gingham dress against his muzzle.</p>

<p>"Find her! Find her!" she commanded.
"Go, go! Find her!"</p>

<p>The St. Bernard shook himself free of the
chain that had bound him, looked into the faces
that peered at him through the dim lantern-light,
and then, giving a long sniff, proud, human,
and contemptuous, walked slowly and majestically
toward the sod barn. The family
followed wonderingly.</p>

<p>When the corn-cribs were reached, the dog
quickened his pace to a trot and began to wave
his big, bushy tail in friendly greeting to something
that, farther on in the dark, could not be
seen by the little girl's mother and the big
brothers. And when he came near the wide,
closed door of the barn, in front of which
showed indistinctly the forms of a large and a
small animal, he leaped forward with a welcoming
bark that was answered by another from a
dog lying in the deep shadow against the door.</p>

<p>For there stood the blind black colt and the
pinto with the bridle-reins still swinging across
her neck. And on her back lay the little girl,
her arms hanging down on either side of the
sheepskin saddle-blanket, her head pillowed
in sleep against her horse's mane.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>A PARIAH OF THE PRAIRIES</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE young cowbird, perched tail to windward
on a stone beside the road, raised
his head, and uttered a hoarse cry of hunger and
lonesomeness as a great black flock of his own
kind, sweeping by on its way to the grazing
herd in the gully, shadowed the ground about
him for an instant.</div>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he called plaintively,
rolling his eyes and ruffling his throat; "look-see!
look-see!"</p>

<p>But the flock, dipping and rising in swift
flight, sped on unheeding. The long summer
day was drawing to a close over the prairie, and
with early evening myriads of gnats and mosquitos
swarmed up from the sloughs to drink
their fill on the flanks of the stamping cows.
The insects offered a fat supper to the birds as
they clung to the twitching hides of the cattle.
So the flock was hastening to reach the gully before
milking-time.</p>

<p>The young cowbird called disconsolately
again and again after the shadow of the flock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was far away, making a moving blot across
the darkening plains. Then, discouraged, he
tucked his head under his wing, clutched the
stone more tightly with his claws, and rocked
gently back and forth as the soft south breeze
spread his tail, lifted his growing pinions, and
blew his new feathers on end.</p>

<p>He was a tramp and the descendant of a long
line of tramps, all as black and hoarse and
homeless as himself. A vagabond of the blackbird
world, he had, like many an unfeathered
exile, only sleep to make him forget his empty
craw, and only a wayside rock for his resting-place.</p>

<p>He had been an outcast from the beginning.
One day in the spring his tramp mother, too
shiftless to build a home for herself, had come
peeping and spying about the fuzzy nest of
some yellow warblers that had built in an elder-bush
by the river; and finding the birds away,
had laid a big white egg speckled with brown
in the midst of four dainty pale-blue ones that
were wreathed with tiny dots. Then she had
slipped away as quickly as possible, abandoning
her own to the more tender mercies of the
little canary pair.</p>

<p>It was the warblers' first nesting, or they
would have known, the moment they saw the
large egg among their small ones, that they had
been imposed upon, and would either have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
pushed the interloper out or built a second story
to their home and left the cowbird's egg in the
basement. But they were young and inexperienced,
so they had only wondered a little at
the size and color of their last lay, and let it
remain.</p>

<p>The weeks had passed. Then, one day, there
had been a great chattering about the warm
cup of milkweed fiber and thistle-down in the
elder-bush, husky cheeping from the nest mingling
with the joyous chirps of the mother-bird
as she tilted and danced on its edge or fluttered
ecstatically above it; and from the end of a
swaying twig close by had swelled the proud
song of the male.</p>

<p>The big egg had hatched.</p>

<p>When the first nestling had freed himself
from his shell and tried his long, wabbly legs,
he opened a wide-gaping, clamorous red mouth
above his naked little body; and this set the yellowbirds
on such persistent and successful
searches after worms, that by the time the
young cowbird's foster brothers and sisters
were out, he had grown big and strong. So the
newer babies had been squeezed from the cozy
center of their warm home to a place on its
chilly rim.</p>

<p>Affairs in the nest had soon come to a sad
pass. The little warblers' weak voices and
short necks were not able to win the reward of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tidbits claimed by the young cowbird, who ruthlessly
stood upon them as he snatched his food
from the bills of the yellowbirds. One by one
they sickened and died, and were then pushed
out into the wet grass below. After that the
young cowbird had been fed faster and more
fondly than ever.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the warblers were away
foraging for the nest, the cowbird, now well
feathered, had tried his wings a little, and had
flown to a clump of tall weeds not far off.
Alighting safely, and emboldened by success,
he had eluded a hungry snake that hunted him
across the gopher knolls, and finally gone on to
the top of the hill. When twilight came he had
found a perch in a pile of tumbleweed, far from
the sheltering bushes by the river. So the warblers,
coming home late with two long wrigglers
for him, had found the nest empty. They had
darted anxiously about it for a while, then the
male had settled upon a swinging elder-branch
to sing a mournful song to his mute, grief-stricken
mate.</p>

<p>Their last baby was gone.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the little girl came trudging along the
road that evening on her way to the farm-house,
she sat down for a moment opposite the stone
on which the cowbird was perched. And after
examining a sand cut that was giving her some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
trouble under her little toe, she suddenly caught
sight of the dumpy black ball that was moving
back and forth with every gust. She leaned
forward on her knees to see what it was, and
crept slowly toward him until she was within
reach. Then, before he had time to take his
head from under his wing, she put out one
hand and seized him.</p>

<p>He was terribly frightened and struggled to
get free, pushing vigorously against her fingers
with wings and claws. But she only tightened
her grasp as he fought, and he was soon so
closely held that he could not move. She forgot
her sore toe in her happiness over catching him,
and started homeward on the run. As she
bounded along, he watched her with his small,
scared eyes.</p>

<p>On reaching the farm-house the little girl put
him into a rough slat cage that hung in her
room; and while he stretched his cramped legs,
and opened his crumpled wings, she hurried to
the window, where she captured a handful of
house-flies. She placed them in front of him,
and he retreated to the farthest corner of the
cage, to beat the bars in terror. But after she
had hidden herself behind the headboard of the
bed, he came forward and ate up the flies without
stopping to take a breath between gulps.
Then he snuggled down on a piece of her worn-out
woolen dress, and went to sleep again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the little girl was yet only five and
a half years old, she had tried many times in her
life, without success, to make the slat cage the
home of some feathery pet. Snipes and plover,
orioles and ovenbirds, bobolinks and meadow-larks,
all had lived in it by turns for a few days.
But the snipes and plover had gone into a decline,
the orioles and ovenbirds had grown thin
and unkempt, and the bobolinks and meadow-larks
had eaten themselves to death. Sorrowful
over so much misfortune, she had longed to
secure a hardy bird that would not only live in
captivity, but would repay her loving care with
songs.</p>

<p>The young cowbird proved to be just what
she had wanted. Every day he grew larger,
plumper, and hungrier; and though he was not
a song-bird, his attempts at melody, made with
much choking and wheezing and many wry
faces,&mdash;as if the countless flies he had swallowed
were sticking in his throat,&mdash;pleased her more
than carols. Within a week after his capture he
was so tame that he would sit on her shoulder
as she walked about her room and peck at her
teeth. She was certain that he was giving her
so many loving kisses; but her big brothers unsympathetically
explained that he thought she
had some kernels of corn between her lips.</p>

<p>It was not long before he was allowed the
freedom of the sitting-room a little while every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
afternoon, and the little girl always sat and
watched him as he walked solemnly about it,
taking long steps, calling happily in his husky
voice, and pecking curiously at the bright rags
in the crocheted rug.</p>

<p>This freedom worked wonders with his plumage.
His dark brown head fairly shone, his
sable breast and back grew glossy, and his
wings took on faint, changing tints of purple
and blue. His jet rudder, daily dressed to its
iridescent tip by his ebony beak, was flicked
jauntily as he strode around on his long black
legs. And all this alert, engaging beauty won
the friendship of the farm-house, including
even that of the little girl's big brothers, who
advised her to clip his wings if she wanted to
keep him; for when he had once reached full
size, they said, he would fly away to join the
cowbird colonies up the river. But the little
girl would never consent to any use of the
scissors.</p>

<p>Throughout the remainder of the summer he
went everywhere with her, perching on her
shoulder when she drove the cattle to the meadows,
riding with her on the pinto if she
were sent on an errand, or walking beside her
in the farm-yard. He never flew far from her,
and could always be coaxed back if she whistled
and showed her teeth. They spent many an afternoon
together on the prairie while the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
girl herded. And when the cows were headed
away from the wheat and were grazing quietly,
he would leave her and fly to the back of Liney,
the muley, where he would walk up and
down the broad, white mark that ran from her
horns to her tail, and catch insects. Liney, who
liked the sharp thrust of his bill where a mosquito
had been stinging, was careful not to
wiggle her hide and scare him away. At dinner-time
he joined the little girl and shared her
gingerbread.</p>

<p>One night, just before the cows started for the
milking-pen, a big flock of cowbirds flew down
and alighted in the midst of them, some of the
birds perching upon the backs of the cattle to
catch their supper. When the little girl saw the
black company, she looked around for her bird,
but could not tell him from the others. There
were three perched upon Liney's back, and,
hoping that one of them was he, she ran toward
the cow, calling softly and showing her teeth.
But as she came close, the three flew away to the
roan heifer. Half weeping, she ran after them,
calling still, and smiling to entice him. The
birds rose into the air again, this time alighting
around the farthest cow in the herd.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with sorrow, the little girl
turned back to where the cattle-gad lay, holding
her apron up to her wet eyes as she stumbled
miserably along. But just as she flung herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
down beside the whip, there came a harsh call
from behind her, where the lunch-pail stood.
It was the cowbird.</p>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he cried, pecking at
the brown paper that held the gingerbread.
Jumping up, the little girl ran to him and
caught him tenderly to her breast.</p>

<p>He was so inquisitive that he soon became unpopular
at the farm-house, and on several occasions
all but had his neck wrung for wrongdoing.
One day he picked the eldest brother's
fiddle-strings in two; another time he was discovered
digging holes in the newly baked loaves
of bread that had been set in a window to cool;
and, again, he stole hot potatoes out of a kettle
on the kitchen stove. But whenever danger
threatened, the little girl championed him valiantly.
So time after time he escaped merited
punishment, which was to have been not less
than death or exile; for he was too small to
whip.</p>

<p>But one morning in the early fall he was confronted
with a very grave charge&mdash;one that was,
if proved true, to cost him his life or his home:
the little girl's mother, on going into the kitchen
at sunrise to prepare breakfast, discovered all
her crocks of milk disturbed and the shelf behind
the stove, on which they stood in a long,
yellow row, spattered with milk from end to
end. As she turned, very puzzled, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
shelf to the table, she saw the cowbird gravely
walking about on the white oil-cloth.</p>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he cried to her, flirting
his tail and blinking his eyes. "Look-see!
look-see!"</p>

<p>She ran to the table and seized him angrily
in her hands, certain that he had forsaken his
own little pan of water to bathe in the milk.
But when she had looked him over carefully,
and found him dry and tidy from top to toe, she
let him go again, forgetting to feel of the white
oil-cloth upon which he had been promenading,
and which was spattered with milk like the
shelf.</p>

<p>Before the contents of the crocks were thrown
out that morning, the little girl's mother called
all of the big brothers in to view the mess; and
by the time breakfast was over, the cowbird had
been passed around, for every one wanted to see
if any milk could be found on him. None was
discovered, however, so the little girl was allowed
to carry him away in triumph on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>For two or three mornings after that the milk
was not visited by the marauder. Then for several
days in succession it was splashed about
on shelf, stove, and floor, and the little girl's
mother was more puzzled than ever. The cowbird
was no longer under suspicion, for the big
brothers had not been able to fasten the guilt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
upon him, since his feathers were always as
sleek and shining as the coat of a curried horse.</p>

<p>It was decided to poison a part of the milk for
several nights and put the rest carefully in the
cupboard. This was done; but though morning
after morning the shelf was sprinkled as badly
as ever, no dead body of cat, bird, or wild animal
was ever found in the kitchen to solve the
mystery. So a new plan was adopted, and tin
pans were put upside down over the crocks to
keep the nightly visitor out.</p>

<p>This arrangement worked well for a week or
more; then one morning there was a terrific
rattling and banging in the kitchen, followed
by deathly stillness. Certain that the disturber
of the milk was at hand, the entire family
rushed pell-mell through the sitting-room and
down the entry to the kitchen door, which they
flung wide open, and excitedly peered in. On
the floor lay a tin pan that had been knocked
from its place, and in one side of it was a large
dent where it had struck the stove in falling.
The milk in the uncovered vessel was not disturbed,
and there was no sign of any living
thing in the room.</p>

<p>Baffled and wondering, they returned to their
beds. But the little girl, before going back to
hers, remained behind a moment to look for the
cowbird. At last she spied him, perched high
up on the elbow of the stovepipe. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
trembling violently, and his glossy, black feathers
were standing out&mdash;straight on end.</p>

<p>The neighbor woman, who dropped in that
noon, made a suggestion that the big brothers
decided to act upon. She declared that the
kitchen visitor was a milk-snake, and that one
night spent on the watch without a light would
prove her correct. So that very evening, the
eldest brother, wrapped in a buffalo robe
and a pair of blankets, sat on a bench behind
the kitchen door, resolved to keep awake
till morning in wait for the mysterious disturber.
The rest of the family prepared for
bed, after providing him with the musket, powder
and buck-shot, and the clothes-stick; and on
looking in upon him before retiring, found him
sitting grimly in his corner, the musket leaning
against one shoulder, while upon the other
perched the cowbird.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising next day when the little
girl's mother awoke. She was surprised at
not having been aroused earlier by the noise of
an encounter, and, accompanied by the little
girl and the other big brothers, tiptoed quickly
but softly down the entry to listen. All was
quiet. She pushed the kitchen door open a little
to look at the crocks. They had not been molested.
Then she put her head in. As she did
so, the husky cry of the cowbird came from the
bench behind the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he called, as he
walked up and down the eldest brother from
head to foot; "look-see! look-see!"</p>

<p>And the family, entering, beheld the eldest
brother stretched upon the bench&mdash;fast asleep.</p>

<p>He was so provoked at having been found
napping that, when he heard their laughter and
awoke, he grabbed the cowbird and threw him
across the kitchen. The cowbird lighted upon
his feet unhurt, and started boldly back again.
But the little girl was frightened over his bad
treatment, and running to him, took him up tenderly,
and carried him to her room. He was
put into the slat cage for the rest of the day, and
for several weeks after that slept in it every
night.</p>

<p>It was now autumn. The husked corn filled
the cribs to bursting, the wheat lay in yellow
heaps on the granary floor, and the hay, stacked
high, stood along the north side of the low, sod
barn in a sheltering crescent. There was little
left to do on the farm before the winter set in,
and the cold mornings found the family astir
very late. So one raw day, when the fields and
prairie without lay white in a covering of thick
frost, it was after sun-up before the little girl's
mother entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>It had been so long since the milk had been
disturbed that she had neglected for a week or
more to cover the crocks, and did not even give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the shelf a glance as she hurriedly lighted a
twist of hay; but as she stooped to poke it into
the stove, a quavering, plaintive, raspy voice
above her made her start back and stare upward.</p>

<p>There on the edge stood the cowbird, his head
drooping and his wings half spread. But he
was no longer black. From his crown to his
legs he was covered with a coating of frozen
milk that, hiding his glossy plumage, turned
him into a woefully bedraggled white bird;
while from the ends of his once glistening tail
feathers hung little icicles that formed an icy
fringe.</p>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he mourned, closing
his eyes and lifting one stiff leg from his perch.
"Look-see! look-see!"</p>

<p>A moment later, hearing the sound of loud
laughter in the kitchen, the little girl got out of
bed and ran to find out what was the matter.
But when she caught sight of the cowbird on the
shelf before the row of big brothers, she did
not join in the merriment. Instead, she turned
very white and crept back to bed again without
a word, taking the cowbird with her, cuddled
under her arm.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the sun stood over the farm-house and
the frost was gone from the plains, the little girl
climbed upon her pony's back and, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cowbird perched on her shoulder, started northward
up the river. Her face was whiter than it
had been that morning, and she had no happy
chatter with which to answer him as he chirruped
to her gaily and leaned forward from
time to time to peck at her teeth. Her ears were
still ringing with her big brothers' laughter,
and with the pitiless command that had driven
the cowbird forth to the prairies again&mdash;a wing-clipped
tramp and an outcast! Straight on she
rode to the river meadows where the cowbird
colonies lived.</p>

<p>Once there, she got down carefully from her
horse and, after placing her pet gently upon
a stone, took from her pockets a crust, part of
a shriveled apple, a chunk of gingerbread, and
a cold boiled potato. These she placed in
front of him on the ground. Then she took
him up, parted her lips to let him peck her
teeth once more, held him against her breast
for a long, bitterly sad moment, and mounting,
rode away.</p>

<p>When she was only a rod or so from him, the
cowbird tried to follow. But his maimed wings
would not obey, and he fell back to the ground
again and again. Then he walked a few steps
after the retreating pony, and, finding that the
little girl was getting farther and farther away
every moment, hopped upon a big rock beside
the road, and called after her pleadingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look-see! look-see!" he cried, rolling his
eyes and swelling his shining throat; "look-see!
look-see!"</p>

<p>But the little girl rode straight on, and never
looked back to see.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<h3>THE MISFIT SCHOLAR</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was only a little way to the school-house
in the winter-time because the big brothers
could cross the chain of sloughs to it on their
skates; but, in the autumn, before the ice was
thick, the path led snake-like beside the eastern
border of the water, just skirting the frill of
green bulrushes and tall marsh-grass, and it
was a long distance.</div>

<p>The school-house stood in a wide glade that
was the favorite grazing-spot of a band of
antelope. It was narrow and unpainted, with
two windows on each side and a door in one
end. And from its roof, which was not too
high for a game of "anti-I-over," protruded
a joint of rusty stovepipe. During spring and
summer the building stood empty, with the
whole sloping green place to itself and the
pronghorns, and in every high wind it toppled
over, with its pipe pointing to the east, until
it was pried into place again. But, after school
"took up" in the fall, the glade rang with
the laughter and shouts of the scholars, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
antelope crossed the Vermillion and traveled
to the rugged country farther west, where,
when the snow fell and hid the dried grass,
they could browse off the bushes; and the
school-house did not topple any more, for its
deep coal-bins, which were built against the
wall by the door, were full to the brim.</p>

<p>Often on warm summer afternoons, the little
girl rode down to the glade beyond the sloughs
and, sitting her horse quietly, induced a tawny
doe and her twin kids to approach by exciting
their curiosity with her bright red flannel
petticoat. But if she took the herd along, she
did not dare display her skirt, for Napoleon
did not like it and had, on one occasion,
viciously gored the Indian pony in the ribs
when the little girl was busy coaxing the deer.
After a wind-storm she liked to climb from her
pony to the overturned school-house and walk
about on it. Once, she slipped on a window-pane,
when she was peering in, and fell
through; and would have had to remain there
a long time (for the door was locked), if she
had not thought to pull the joint of stovepipe
out of the roof and crawl through the hole
to freedom.</p>

<p>But she had never been near the building
when the teacher was in charge. She did not
want to go to school, because she meant to learn
her lessons at home the way her mother had,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
her mother had been taught by <i>her</i> mother,
and, after that, by a governess. The little girl
had never talked the matter over at the farm-house,
however, for she never doubted that the
governess, whatever that was, would come all
in good time.</p>

<p>So her surprise and grief were great when
she heard one day that she was to learn her
lessons from the lanky Yankton man who
presided over the school, and along with the
other little girls who lived near enough to attend.
She held one tearful argument after another
with the eldest brother, declaring that she
could read and study at home. But he said
that a young one nearly six years old ought to
know something more than stories&mdash;something
about the world and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Secretly the little girl did not think it was
of any use going to school, for she believed
the teacher did not know much. She had even
heard the biggest brother say so. And she
knew that <i>she</i> knew a great deal. As soon
as she could eat with a spoon, she had begun
to hold the almanac up in front of her; and she
had spoken her first word at fourteen months.
It was "Man," and her mother often related
how it happened.</p>

<p>She was rocking the little girl to sleep, she
said, and singing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There was a little man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he had a little gun,"</span><br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>when there sounded a small voice from the
cradle. "Man," it said, and the little girl's
mother, peeking over the side, saw two wide-open
blue eyes. After that, when she was
being rocked to sleep, the little girl always said,
"Man." Three months later, she had begun
to talk in whole sentences. At three years she
had been able to make all her letters and
read several words, having been taught secretly
by the biggest brother. At four, she knew the
youngest brother's reading lessons by heart,
and could spell every word in the First Reader.
At this stage of her education, she put aside such
baby things as the "Mother Goose Rhymes,"
and was deeply interested in the doings of the
"Swiss Family Robinson." Winter nights,
she had listened to an ever increasing number
of stories that were read aloud by her mother.
And now she was occupied with "Gulliver."
But she did not know one of her multiplication
tables, and the neighbor woman, for one, was
greatly disgusted with her, and declared that
she did not know whatever would become of
the child.</div>

<p>The morning the little girl started to school,
with her Second Reader under one arm, it
was so cold that her breath looked like puffs
of white steam. Her mother thought she had
better walk instead of ride, and bundled her
up warmly in a big plaid shawl, her beaver
cap, and her thick mittens. When she set off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
she was accompanied by the youngest brother,
who was going to be a visitor during the morning
session. The dogs, with the exception of
Luffree (who could not be found), had been
chained up along the sunny side of the house
to keep them from following her. And as they
saw her disappearing across the reservation
road, they jumped back and forth, pulling at
their collars and howling dismally.</p>

<p>The little girl did not look around at them.
Her heart was heavy. All the unhappiness that
had been visited upon her that autumn weighed
it down. Every day, before sunrise, she had
had to get up and eat a raw carrot, because the
neighbor woman had prescribed it as a cure
for a certain livid spot that had made its appearance
on the little girl's cheek, and was
thought to be a cancer. The little girl knew that
the carrot-eating was useless, since the spot
was only the mark of an unsuccessful attempt
at tattooing; but she did not care to explain.
Then, the cowbird had been sent away; and,
as a last blow, she had been told to go to school.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in her mind that her
misfortunes were due wholly to the fact that
she had precisely thirteen freckles on her pink
nose. She had never been able to count them
because, when she had covered ten of the tiny
brown spots with as many fingers, so much of
her nose was hidden that she could count no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
further. But the biggest brother had assured
her that she had them, and that was enough.</p>

<p>She was very tired when they came in sight
of the school-house, and the youngest brother
had to tug her along by the hand. Luffree, who
had come in sight over a hillock ahead of them
when they were part way, trotted at her heels
and looked up wistfully at her as she half
walked, half ran, complaining at every step.
Now and then he jumped up and tried to lick
her face sympathetically. But she would not let
him, for she knew he had warts on his muzzle
that he had caught the summer before while
teasing a toad.</p>

<p>The school-room was full of smoke and noise
when they entered. The scholars were laughing
and talking as they crowded about the
tall, round stove; and it was sending black,
sooty breath into their faces from every crevice
of its loosely hung doors. But shortly afterward
the noise was silenced by the teacher, who
brought his hands together with a resounding
clap.</p>

<p>All the pupils in the room, except the little
girl, had been to school to him the year before
and knew what the signal meant. So she suddenly
found herself the only one left standing
in the middle of the floor, the girls having preempted
the row of benches on the right, and
the boys that on the left. But she was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
abashed, and her corkscrew curls danced on her
shoulders as she looked about.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down!" came in whispers
from both sides. She took no notice of them,
and the teacher, busily preparing the roll-call
at his table, did not hear. But soon a ripple of
laughter from the school, and a voice from the
stove, interrupted his work, and brought him
scowling to his feet.</p>

<p>The little girl was standing with one arm
extended and one small forefinger pointing
past him at the globe, which, for want of a better,
was but a fat pumpkin ingeniously impaled
on a stick, and peeled over part of its surface
in such a manner that the five oceans were represented,
while the portion yet unpeeled showed
the rude outlines of the six continents.</p>

<p>"We've got lots of pumpkins bigger 'n that
at our house," she was saying, her face turned
toward "Frenchy," an up-river trapper who
studied geography and English spelling between
his rounds of the sloughs. "Why, the
cellar's <i>full</i> of 'em."</p>

<p>The teacher rapped briskly on the table
with his pencil, to call her to order. "Look
here," he said, a little crossly, "you mustn't
talk out like that. Sit down."</p>

<p>"No seat," she faltered, lowering her voice.</p>

<p>He looked up and down the girls' row; there
were only four seats in it, and they were full.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The boys' benches were not; but, loath to lessen
the terrors of a favorite punishment, he hesitated
to put her there. "Come up to the rostrum,
then," he said.</p>

<p>The little girl walked slowly forward, and
a flush stole up her throat and mounted to her
temples. But when she was once seated, her
sailor-hat on one side and her Second Reader
on the other, she felt less demeaned; for the
rostrum commanded a view of the whole room,
and from it she could see Luffree, fast asleep
under the youngest brother's bench.</p>

<p>The teacher went back to the roll-call, and the
pupils droned the time away till recess. Then
the boys rummaged through their willow baskets
for something to eat and went out to play
"prisoner's base." But the girls&mdash;the neighbor
woman's daughter, and the seven belonging
to the Dutchman who lived at the Vermillion's
forks&mdash;stayed in, gathered in a silent circle
about the rostrum, fingered the big gold brooch
that the little girl's mother had let her wear as
a reward for attending, and looked her up and
down, from the scarlet bow on her hair to her
fringed leggings. And she, never having seen
the Dutchman's children before, forgot to be
polite, and stared back at their denim dresses,
pigtails, and wooden shoes.</p>

<p>When school took up again, the Swede boy
was told to put his sums on a bit of tar-papered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wall near him, and a mixed class in reading
lined up in front of the teacher's table. Soon,
however, the room was again quiet. The Swede
boy and the class sat down, and the whole
school, made sleepy by the warmth from the
stove, lounged on their benches and drowsed
on their books, and even the little girl, sitting
idly on the rostrum, nodded wearily. But
right in the midst of the silence, and just before
the pupils were dismissed for noon, something
so startling happened that the little girl's
curls fairly stiffened in alarm.</p>

<p>The teacher clapped his hands, the children
followed with a hurried banging of their books
and slates, and, instantly, before the little girl
had time to think what it all meant, the scholars,
with one accord, began to roar at the top of
their lungs.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Scotland's burning! Scotland's burning!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>they cried, rapping their knuckles upon their
desks in the rhythm of galloping horses,&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"More water! More water!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">More water! More water!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The little girl straightened herself and a
gray light crept up to where the flush had been,
so that every freckle of the hateful thirteen
stood out clearly. Near her, the teacher was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
standing, with his feet planted wide apart and
his eyes raised to the ceiling. And before him,
shouting and pounding and staring with crimson
faces into his, were the pupils.</p>

<div class='center'>
"Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>they yelled. It brought back to the little girl
that terrible moment when the farm-house, with
a dripping-pan full of hog-fat flaming in the
oven, was threatened with destruction.</div>

<div class='center'>
"Scotland's burning! Scotland's burning!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sounded the warning again. No one moved.
But, not knowing just how near Scotland might
be, and fearful for her safety with danger
so imminent, she did not wait longer. Clutching
her hat and book, with a bound she cleared
the distance to the youngest brother, and, with
a stifled cry, leaped into his arms.</div>

<p>But in her excitement she had forgotten
Luffree, lying asleep under the bench, and had
jumped squarely upon one soft, outstretched
paw. The dog sprang up with a howl of pain,
the school stopped its singing, and the angry
teacher left the rostrum and advanced toward
the little girl. The next moment he dragged
the dog from under the bench by the scruff of
the neck and hurled him out of the door; the
next, he shook an admonishing finger in the
very face of the thirteen unlucky freckles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> that afternoon, the eldest brother paddled
across the sloughs in the bull-boat, and had
a talk with the teacher. The teacher lived in
the Irishman's shack, which was made of cottonwood
logs laid one upon another and covered
with a roof of sticks and dirt, and
"bached" by himself through the term, because
the little girl's mother had refused to board
him. So, when the eldest brother had finished
his visit and rowed back, he recited such an
ill-natured version of that day's happenings at
the school-house, that the family, until then
divided by the contradictory stories of the
youngest brother and the little girl, united in
heaping reproaches upon her.</p>

<p>Next morning she again traveled the winding
path that skirted the marsh-grass and bulrushes,
this time on the pinto. Luffree, who
had been tied up at breakfast, but had mysteriously
slipped his collar, followed, as before.
When she arrived within a short distance of
the school-house, she climbed down and, without
taking any notice of the giggling, waiting
crowd by the door, carefully picketed the mare
out of reach of the other ponies. Then she
pulled off the bridle, put it beside the picket-pin,
and, after bidding Luffree watch beside
it, went in quietly to take her seat. She had
not unblanketed her horse because, underneath
the soft sheepskin saddle and well out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of sight, was tucked one of her mother's latest
magazines that had pictures scattered
through it.</p>

<p>When school was called, she was not allowed
to keep the seat on the rostrum. One of the
Dutchman's seven being absent, she was told
to share the rear bench with the neighbor
woman's daughter, and spent a happy hour
in the seclusion of the high seat, watching
"Frenchy," who had no slate, write his spelling
on the smooth, round stove, and smiling
at the Swede boy when he looked slyly across
at her.</p>

<p>Then she heard some one call her name. It
was the teacher. "Come forward to the chart,"
he said, and his voice seemed to shake the very
floor.</p>

<p>She took up her Second Reader, edged herself
off her seat, and stood beside it, her eyes
fixed questioningly upon him.</p>

<p>"Come forward to the chart, I say," he said
again. "Can't you hear!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the little girl, starting up
the room. But she walked so slowly that, when
she came near his table, he put out one lean
hand, grabbed her by the arm, and hurried
her. She resented his touch by twisting about
until she was free. Then she took her place in
front of the chart, feeling as if every eye in
the room were looking up and down the row<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of blue crockery buttons on the back of her
apron.</p>

<p>The teacher began to turn forward sheet after
sheet of the chart, until the first page was before
him. It depicted a figure in silk hat, long coat,
and light trousers, promenading with a cane
in his hand and a dog at his heels. Underneath
were two lines of simple words, and two inquiring
sentences. The teacher picked up a
long cottonwood stick and pointed it first at
the man and then at the dog.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he said.</p>

<p>"A man," answered the little girl.</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"A dog."</p>

<p>"Now read after me," he went on, indicating
a word, "'M-a-n, man.'"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, her lips pressed
tightly together.</p>

<p>"Read, read, read!" commanded the teacher,
whacking the chart with a pointer.</p>

<p>"'M-a-n, man,'" repeated the little girl, her
eyes on his face.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me," he scolded; "look at
the chart."</p>

<p>"I don't haf' to," said the little girl, earnestly;
"I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something unpleasant would certainly have
happened at that moment, had not "Frenchy,"
deep in his geography lesson, piped up at the
teacher from the rear of the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"T-a-n-g-a-n-y-i-k-a," he spelled, snapping
his fingers and waving his arm. "Wot eez
dat?"</p>

<p>For a moment the teacher was silent, scowling
down at the little girl. Then he came back to
the chart with another whack of the pointer.
"Call it Moses," he growled.</p>

<p>"Mozez," repeated "Frenchy," resignedly,
but with a shake of his head over the intricacies
of the English language.</p>

<p>The little girl had twisted half around to
look at a Dutch child, and the teacher, angry
because he had neglected to look over the
geography lesson, jerked her into place again
by her sleeve. "Now, you read," he said;
"look at the end of my pointer and read."</p>

<p>"I can read them words 'thout looking at
'em," she protested, pointing at an inquiring
line, "'cause I can read everyfing in this."
And she held up the Second Reader.</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted the teacher, taking the book
from her and tossing it upon his table. "Have
you ever been to school before?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the little girl.</p>

<p>"Then you'll start right in where everybody
else does," he said. "Read this line.
'Do you see a man?'"</p>

<p>"'Doyouseeaman?'" she repeated, still
watching him.</p>

<p>"Look at the chart and read it," he commanded
furiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>An unfriendly light suddenly shone in the little
girl's eyes. She stepped back and summoned
all her pride to resent the indignity
that he was putting upon her before the whole
school.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to read that baby talk,"
she cried, "and&mdash;and&mdash;I <i>won't</i>, and I 'm going
home to my mother."</p>

<p>The teacher swayed in his wrath like a tall
cottonwood. "You don't, eh? You won't,
eh?" he bellowed, and, stooping down,
plucked the little girl by the ear.</p>

<p>This time it was the Swede boy who interrupted
the course of events in front. He
leaned forward and whispered something into
the ear of the boy ahead, and then, with an
inarticulate shout, threw himself upon the boy
and began to maul him. Instantly the teacher,
yearning to use his hands upon some one, descended
upon them and wrested them apart.
But they clinched again and, continuing to
fight, managed so to misdirect their kicks that
they reached, not each other, but his lanky, interfering
person.</p>

<p>And, while the battle raged, the little girl fled
out of the school-house toward the pinto and
pulled up the picket-pin. The teacher did not
see her go, but, in retreating from an unusually
vicious blow of the Swede boy's fist, caught
sight of her just as she was leading her horse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to an ant-hill to mount. With a hoarse call
for her to return, he started after her, bearing
in his train the two boys, who, still struggling,
impeded his progress.</p>

<p>He shook them off at the door-step and broke
into a run. The little girl was vainly striving
to climb to the pinto's back; but she was so
frightened that each time she made a jump
for the saddle she came short of it and fell back.
And, seeing the teacher coming, her efforts were
more ineffectual than ever. But when he was
scarcely a rod away, and when escape seemed
impossible, a new figure joined in the affair.</p>

<p>Luffree had been lying quietly beside the
picket-pin until the little girl ran out, when
he got up, ready to follow her, and joyfully
leaped about the mare. Then he saw the teacher
advancing, and remembered the rough handling
of the day before. So, as the Yankton man
came close, swinging his arms about like the
fans of the Dutchman's windmill, the dog
went forward to meet him, his hair on end, his
eyes shifting treacherously, his teeth showing
in an ugly white seam, all the wolf blood in
him roused.</p>

<p>The teacher halted when he saw him and
called back to the scholars, now crowding
about the door. "Bring my pointer," he cried.</p>

<p>Not a pupil moved. The teacher, noting that
no one was obeying his order, and not daring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to go forward unarmed, ran back at the top
of his speed for the stick. But he was too late;
for, by the time he had gained the school-room
and grabbed both the pointer and the stove
poker, the little girl had scrambled upon her
pinto and galloped off toward the farm-house.</p>

<p>The teacher did not give chase, but, sputtering
revenge under his breath, called the school
to order. Then, not forgetting what severity
is due insubordination where the sons of salary-supplying
fathers are concerned, he gave
the boys who had fought, but who were now
docile and smiling, a mighty tongue-lashing.</p>

<p>When the little girl was beyond hailing distance
or possibility of capture, she brought the
pinto to a standstill and looked back. Once she
opened her lips as if to say something, but
closed them again, and, after waiting until the
scholars had all gone in, rode on. She did not
go home; instead, when she came in sight of
the reservation road, she turned east and cantered
across the prairie until only the top of the
farm-house was visible to her as she sat upon
her horse. Then she dismounted, tethered the
pinto, made Luffree lie down, and, having taken
the magazine from under the saddle-blankets,
cuddled against the dog. She was still trembling,
her throat ached with unspoken anger,
and, underneath her apron, her heart bounded
so that the checks moved in regular time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>But soon she wiped her blurred eyes and
turned to the pictures in the magazine. They
began with a red-brown one of a storm-tossed
ship on a rocky coast; and, following, were
drawings of queer boxes and chairs and, yet
more strange, of a herd of grazing cattle <i>with
a board fence around it</i>! There was also a
funny picture of a ragged boy and a stylish little
girl who wore a round hat and a polonaise.
And, lastly, there was shown a beautiful young
woman standing by a table in a long, loose robe,
very much like the army chaplain's.</p>

<p>It was over this picture that the little girl bent
longest, and she read, not without some tedious
spelling, the words that were printed beneath it:</p>

<p>"Mary, in cap and gown, was so bright and
dainty a vision that the professor wished that
more young ladies of gentle birth might attend
the college."</p>

<p>College! It was not a new word to the little
girl, for she had heard the colonel tell her
mother that he was going to send his son to
college. But now she knew that girls as well as
boys could go. And she saw by the picture that
they wore beautiful flowing robes and square
caps.</p>

<p>It was the cap that specially attracted her, for
it rested becomingly upon a mass of wavy
hair. She wished that her curls, which had to
be coaxed into shape every morning with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
warm stove-lifter and a wet brush, would hang
in ripples like the young woman's, so that she
could wear one.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>ain't</i> it sweet!" she said aloud, getting
up on her knees beside Luffree and holding out
the book at arm's length. And then, with the
mortar-board as her inspiration, there flashed
into her brain a wonderful thought that was
to grow through the coming years; and her lips
framed a splendid purpose&mdash;heard by no mortal
ears, save those of the shivering hound and
the cropping pony&mdash;that time was gloriously
to fulfil.</p>

<p>"And maybe," she added happily, "I'll
have 'monia, and my hair'll come in just as
curly."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, fired with her new
ambition, and undid the pony. And remembering
that it would be as well to reach the
farm-house before the family could hear the
second tale of trouble at the school, she hastily
coiled the picket-rope, mounted, hid the magazine
under the saddle-blankets, and, with the
dog running stiffly in her wake, rode homeward.</p>

<p>When she reached the barn, she did not even
wait to fasten the pinto in her stall; but, taking
the magazine, raced toward the kitchen. As
she halted breathless in its open door, however,
she was sorry that she had not come in quietly
by way of her bedroom window and waited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
until she was sure that her mother was alone.
For she found herself in the presence not only
of the big brothers, but of him whose authority
she had so lately flouted!</p>

<p>The suddenness of the discovery drove the
words she had meant to say in her own behalf
from her brain. But five pairs of eyes were
upon her and retreat was impossible; so she
strove mutely to win any possible sympathy by
covering, with one unsteady hand, the ear
that had been pulled.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment. And in that
brief space the little girl divined, as she sought
each face, that but one of the group before her
was eager to see her punished, and that one
was the teacher. In the eyes of the eldest
brother there was no disapproval, only a lurking
smile; the biggest was openly beaming with
satisfaction; the youngest had taken his attitude,
as usual, from the eldest; and her mother's
look was sadly kind. But the teacher
was hostile from brow to boot.</p>

<p>It was the eldest brother who first broke the
silence. He took his pipe from his mouth,
knocked out the ashes against his bench, and
addressed the little girl. "So you went on the
war-path to-day?" he said.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but moved toward her
mother.</p>

<p>"This youngster," he went on, wheeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
around on the teacher, "is well up in them
chart pages and can read pretty good in most
books. So I guess"&mdash;he drawled it out sneeringly&mdash;"as
long as you ain't got any classes
that exactly fit her, she'd better lie fallow for
a while."</p>

<p>The little girl shot a proud glance at the
Yankton man as she heard the eldest brother's
praise, and, emboldened, spoke up for herself.
"I <i>can</i> read all the chart," she declared, "and
I can read everyfing in the First Reader. And
I could spell 'man'"&mdash;she put the hand that
she had been holding over her ear on a level
with her knee&mdash;"when I was so high."</p>

<p>The teacher snorted. "You know your own
business," he said to the eldest brother.</p>

<p>"Guess we do," chimed in the biggest, grinning.
"No use bothering her with a-b, ab, when
she can read the things she does." The teacher
stood up, ready to go. "And I was about to
remark," continued the biggest, banteringly,
"that she's got a lot of mighty nice stories that
she's read and done with; and if you'd like to
borrow one, once in a while, to pass an evenin'
with, you'd find 'em mighty educatin'."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered the teacher; "but
like as not you'll need 'em all to finish up
<i>her</i> eddication on. I guess maybe you'll be
sending her to Sioux Falls in a year or so to
kind o' polish her off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The sarcasm in the voice stung the biggest
brother. "Well," he said, "she could polish
off right here on these plains and have a lot
more in her noddle in a year or two than <i>some</i>
people I know."</p>

<p>This boast of her favorite again brought the
little girl's courage up. "I don't want to go to
a city school," she declared, "'cause they don't
wear caps there."</p>

<p>The teacher was tramping out, with no backward
look or good-by word, and he did not wait
to hear more. So it was the eldest brother
who answered her. "If you don't go here
and you don't go to Sioux Falls," he said,
"I'd like to know where you'll learn anything.
Ma ain't got no time to be your governess."</p>

<p>"I don't want no governess, either," she replied.
"I know what I'm going to do." She
brought forward the magazine, which she had
been holding behind her back with one hand,
and, opening it at the drawing of the young
woman in cap and gown, laid it on the biggest
brother's knee. Then she went up to her mother,
her face fairly shining through the dust
and tear-marks on it. Her mother put out
her arms and gently drew the little girl to her.
Into her mind had come the picture of herself,
in spotless pinafore, bending with her governess
over her English books. And beside that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
picture, the little girl, sunburned, soiled, and
poorly shod, made a sharp contrast.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, pet lamb?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to cut 'nough carpet-rags this
winter to last you a whole year," said the little
girl, "'cause next summer you won't have me
any more. I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;going to college."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> teacher, jogging out of the barn-yard to
the ash-lane, heard a hearty roll of bassos
from the kitchen, and did not doubt but that
he was its target. He reined in his horse at the
bare flower-beds and glowered back at the door.
Then, with a mutter, ungrammatical but eloquent,
he spurred on toward the lonely, supperless
shack by the slough.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF A PLANTING</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE little girl was making believe, as she
planted the corn, that the field was a great
city; the long rows, reaching up from the timothy
meadow to the carnelian bluff, were the
beautiful streets; and the hills, two steps apart,
were the houses. She had a seed-bag slung
under her arm, and when she came to a hill she
put her hand into it and took out four plump,
yellow kernels. And as she went along, dropping
her gifts at each door, she played that she
was visiting and said, "How do you do?" as
politely as she could to the lady of the house,
at the same time taking off her battered blue
sailor-hat and bowing,&mdash;just as she had seen
the lightning-rod agent do to her mother.</div>

<p>She had begun the game by naming every
family she called upon. But it was not long
before she had used up all the names she could
think of&mdash;those of the neighbors, the Indians,
the story-book people, the horses, the cows, the
oxen, the dogs, and even the vegetables in the
garden. So, after having planted a row or two,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
she contented herself with making believe she
was among strangers and just offering a
friendly greeting to every household.</p>

<p>She had come out to the field when the prairie-chickens
were still playing their bagpipes
on the river bank, their booming sounding
through the morning air so clearly that the little
girl had been sure they were not farther than
the edge of the wheat-field, and had walked out
of her way to try to see them, tramping along
in her best shoes, which had shiny copper toes
and store-made laces. But when she had
reached the wheat, the booming, like a will-o'-the-wisp,
had been temptingly farther on; and
she had turned back to the newly marked corn-land.</p>

<p>Her big brothers had sent her out to drop and
cover eighty rows, the last corn-planting to be
done that year on the big Dakota farm. They
had finished the rest of the field themselves and,
intent on getting in the rutabaga crop, had
turned over the remaining strip to the little
girl, declaring that she could drop and cover
forty rows in the morning and forty in the
afternoon, and not half try. To make sure
that she would have time to finish the work, they
had started her off immediately after a five-o'clock
breakfast; and in order that she should
not lose any time at noon, they had made her
take her dinner with her in a tall tin pail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Her first glimpse of the unplanted piece had
greatly discouraged her, for it seemed dreadfully
wide and long. So, after deciding to plant
the whole of it before doing any covering with
the hoe, because the dropping of the corn was
much easier and quicker to do than the hoeing,
she went to work half-heartedly. Now, to make
her task seem short, she had further determined
to play "city."</p>

<p>It was such fun to pretend that, as she went
bobbing and bowing up and down the rows, she
forgot to stop her game and throw clods at the
gray gophers. They lived in the timothy meadow,
and were so bold that, if they were not
watched, they would come out of their burrows
and follow the rows, stealing every kernel out of
the hills as they went along and putting the
booty in their cheek-pouches.</p>

<p>After she had dropped corn as much as a
whole hour, the little girl's back ached, and
when she went to refill her seed-bag at the corn-barrel
that stood on the border of the meadow
near the row-marker, she sat down to rest a moment.
The marker resembled a sleigh, only it
had five runners instead of two, and there were
rocks piled on top of it to make it heavy. So the
minute the little girl's eyes fell upon it and
she saw the runners, she thought of winter.
Winter instantly reminded her of the muskrats
in the slough below the bluff. And with that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
thought she could not resist starting down to see
if they were busy after the thaw.</p>

<p>She gathered many flowers on the way, and
stopped to pull off her shoes and stockings. At
last she reached the slough and waded in to a
muskrat house, where she used her hoe-handle
as a poker to scare out some of the muskrats.
Failing in this, she picked up her shoes and
stockings and went around the slough to find
out if any green leaves were unfolding yet in
the wild-plum thicket. A little later she climbed
the bluff to the corn-field, making a diligent
search for Indian arrowheads all the way.</p>

<p>When she reached the seed-bag again, she
threw the string over her head and started up a
row determinedly. For a rod or more she did
not pause either to be polite or to scare away
gophers, but hurried along very fast, with her
eyes to the ground. Suddenly she chanced to
look just ahead of her, and stopped abruptly,
standing erect. Her shadow pointed straight
for the bluff: it was noon and high time to eat
dinner.</p>

<p>She sat down on the marker and munched
her sandwiches of salted lard and corn-meal
bread with great appetite. She was just finishing
them when the call of a goose far overhead
attracted her attention. She got down and lay
flat on her back, with her head on the seed-bag,
to watch the flock, high above her, speeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
northward to the lakes, their leader crying commands
to the gray company that flew in
V-shaped order behind him. When the geese
were but a dark thread across the north sky,
she felt drowsy and, turning on her side with
her hat over her face and her back to the gentle
spring breeze, went fast asleep.</p>

<p>She lay there for hours, entirely unaware of
the saucy stares of several gophers who paused
in their hunt for kernels and stood straight as
picket-pins to watch and wonder at the little
heap of pink calico under the battered sailor-hat,
or whisked about her, their short legs
flashing, their tails wide and bushy, their cheek-pouches
so full of kernels that they smiled fatly
when they looked at her, and showed four long
front teeth. But the little girl was wrapped in
a happy dream of a certain beautiful red wagon
with a real seat that she had seen in a thick
catalogue sent her mother by a store in a distant
city. So she never moved till late in the afternoon,
when the gentle breeze strengthened to a
sharp wind that, with a petulant gust, whirled
her sailor across the rows and far away.</p>

<p>The flying hat caused a stampede among some
curious gophers who were just then investigating
a near-by unplanted row in the hope of
finding more corn. Clattering shrilly, they
scudded back to the meadow, and the little girl
rose. After a long chase for the hat, she went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
stiffly to work again, not stopping to put on
her shoes and stockings, though the wind was
cold.</p>

<p>After that she planted faithfully, leaving off
only to throw clods at the gophers, or to ease
her back now and then. And it was when she
was resting a moment that she noticed something
that made her begin working harder than
ever. Her shadow stretched out so far to the
eastward that she could not touch its head with
the end of her long hoe. When she first came
out that morning, it had fallen just as far the
other way. She looked anxiously up at the sun,
which was shining slantingly upon the freshly
harrowed land through a gray haze that hung
about it. Then she looked again at her shadow,
distorted and grotesque, that moved when
she moved and mimicked her when she bent
to drop the corn. Its length showed her that
it was getting late, and that she would soon hear
the summoning blast of the cow-horn that hung
behind the kitchen door.</p>

<p>She dropped the seed-bag, walked across the
strip still unplanted, and counted the rows. She
returned on the run. The dropping was little
more than half finished, and no covering had
been done at all. She knew she could not finish
that day; yet if they asked her at the farm-house
if she had completed the planting, she
would not dare to tell them how little of it was
done. She sat down to pull on her shoes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stockings, thinking hard all the while. But,
just as she had one leg dressed, she sprang up
with a happy thought, and stood on the shod
foot like a heron while she dressed the other.
Then, without stopping to lace her shoes, she
tossed her sailor aside, swung the seed-bag to
the front, and began dropping corn as fast as
she could.</p>

<p>The kernels were counted no longer, nor were
they placed in the hills precisely. Without
a glance to right or left, she raced along the
rows, her cheeks flaming and her hair flying
out in the wind. She had decided that she
would <i>plant</i> all of the strip&mdash;but not <i>cover</i> the
corn until next day.</p>

<p>The sun sank slowly toward the horizon as
she worked. But the unplanted rows were rapidly
growing fewer and fewer now, and the
descending disk gave her little worry. Up and
down she hurried, scattering rather than dropping
the seed, until she was on her final trip.
When she reached the end of the last row, she
joyfully put all the corn she had left into one
hill, turned the seed-bag inside out, slipped her
lunch-bucket into it, and, after hiding her hoe
in the stone pile on the carnelian bluff, turned
her face toward the house. And at that very
moment, with the winding of the cow-horn for
its farewell salute, the last yellow rind of the
sun went out of sight below the level line of the
prairie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next day, while the little girl's big
brothers were busy with the chores, she mounted
her pony and rode away southward from the
farm-house. At the reservation road, she
faced toward the sun and struck her horse
to a canter. A mile out on the prairie to the
east, she turned due north up a low ravine;
and finally completed almost a perfect square
by coming west, when on a line with the carnelian
bluff, to the edge of the corn-field.
There she tied her pony to a large stone on the
slope of the bluff and well out of sight of the
house, and, after hunting up the hoe, started
energetically to cover up the planting of the
day before.</p>

<p>She began at the bluff on the first uncovered
row, and swung down it rapidly, her hoe flashing
brightly in the sun as she pulled the dirt
over the kernels. But when she had gone less
than half the distance to the meadow she
stopped at a hill and anxiously examined it a
moment. She went on to the next without
using her hoe, then on to the next and the next;
and, finally, putting it across her shoulder,
walked slowly to the end.</p>

<p>Arrived at the edge of the meadow, she
turned about and followed up another row.
Her hoe was still across her shoulder, and she
did not stop to use it until she was near the
bluff. When she reached the meadow the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
time, she sat down on the row-marker and
looked out across the timothy.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she said, addressing the half-dozen
animated stakes that were eying her
from a proper distance, "you've done it!"</p>

<p>The gophers stood straighter than ever when
they heard her voice, and new ones came from
their burrows and sat up to watch her, with
their fore paws held primly in front of them,
their tails lying out motionless behind, and their
slender heads poised pertly&mdash;with no movement
except the twinkle of sharp, black eyes and the
quiver of long whiskers.</p>

<p>"And there ain't 'nough seed left in that
barrel," went on the little girl, "to plant a
single row over again."</p>

<p>She sat on the marker a long time, a sorrowful
little figure, in deep study. And when she
finally rose and resumed work at the upper end
of the strip, she thought with dread of the
disclosure that sprouting-time would bring.</p>

<p>An hour later, she untied her pony and
climbed wearily upon his back. As she rode
across the meadow toward home, she shook her
head solemnly at the mounds in the timothy.</p>

<p>"I s'pose," she said, "you've <i>got</i> to have
something to lay up for winter; but I think you
might 'a' gone down to mother's veg'table
patch, 'cause, when the corn comes up, I'll
catch it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The corn-stalks were nodding in their first untasseled
sturdiness before the little girl's big
brothers paid the field a visit to see when the
crowding suckers should be pulled and the
first loosening given to the dirt about the hills.
They went down one morning, their muskets
over their shoulders, and the little girl went
with them, hoping that so much time had passed
since the planting that they would not punish
her even if they found fault with her work on
the last eighty rows.</p>

<p>Summer had come in on a carpet of spring
green strewn with wild clover, asters, and blazing-star.
And as they went along, the verdant
prairie rolled away before them for miles in the
warm sunlight, unbroken save where their eyes
passed to the richer emerald of wheat sprinkled
with gay mustard, new flax on freshly turned
sod, or a sea of waving maize. Overhead, the
geese no longer streaked the sky in changing
lines, but swarms of blackbirds filled the air
with crisp calls at their approach, and rose from
the ground in black clouds. Down along the
slough where the wild-plum boughs waved their
blossoms they could see the calves frolicking
together; and up on the carnelian bluff, the
young prairie-chickens scurried through the
grass before a watchful mother.</p>

<p>The little girl trailed, barefooted, behind her
big brothers, and was in no humor to enjoy any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the beauties of earth or sky. With anxious
face she followed them as they penetrated the
lusty stand of corn, going from south to north
on the western side of the field. Then she
tagged less willingly as they turned east toward
the strip she had planted. As they neared it
they remarked a scarcity of stalks ahead; and
when they at last stood on the first of the eighty
rows, they gazed with astonishment at the narrow
belt that showed bravely green at the upper
end by the carnelian bluff, but dark and bare
over the three fourths of its length that sloped
down to the timothy meadow.</p>

<p>"I guess <i>this</i> won't need no thinning," said
the biggest brother, ironically.</p>

<p>They set to work to examine the hills, that
only here and there sent up a lonely shoot,
the little girl standing by and silently watching
them. But they found few signs of the
gopher burrowing they felt sure had devastated
the ground. All at once the eldest brother
had a brilliant thought, and, with a glance at the
little girl, who was nervously twisting her fingers,
paced eastward and counted the rows that
made up the barren strip. There were just
eighty!</p>

<p>He came back and joined his brothers; and
the little girl, standing before him, dared not
lift her eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"Did you plant that corn?" he demanded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ramming the butt of his musket into the
ground.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the little girl, her voice
husky with apprehension. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Did a lot of gophers come in while you's
a-planting?" asked the biggest brother, more
kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, a <i>lot</i>," answered the little girl.</p>

<p>"Did you sling clods at 'em?" demanded the
eldest brother, again pounding the musket into
the dirt.</p>

<p>"Nearly slung my arm off," answered the
little girl.</p>

<p>The eldest brother grunted incredulously.</p>

<p>"It's mighty funny," he said, "that the gophers
liked <i>your</i> planting better 'n anybody
else's."</p>

<p>The little girl did not answer. Her forehead
was puckered painfully as, gripping her
hat, she stood busily curling and uncurling
her toes in the dirt. Her lashes were fluttering
as if she awaited a blow.</p>

<p>"I'll just ask you one thing," went on the
eldest brother; "what's to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The little girl started as if the blow had fallen,
and stammered her answer.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my&mdash;birfday," she said.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;<i>ha</i>," he replied suggestively. Then he
tramped to the timothy meadow, the others
following. And the little girl, walking very
slowly, came on behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the big brothers had gone on to the farm-house,
the little girl still tarried in the corn-field.
Her eldest brother's hint concerning her
birthday had suggested the cruel punishment
she felt certain was to be hers, and she could
not bear to face the family at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>For months she had longed for a little red
wagon&mdash;a wagon with a long tongue, and "Express"
on the side in black letters; and had
planned how she would harness Bruno and
Luffree to it and drive along the level prairie
roads. Evening after evening she had taken
out the thick catalogue and pored over the
prices, and had shown the kind she wanted
again and again to all the big brothers in turn.</p>

<p>Then one day she had surprised her biggest
brother while he was taking a bulky brown-paper
package off the farm wagon on his return
from Yankton. He had sent her into the
house; but she had found out later that the
package was in the corn-crib, and had crept in
there one afternoon, when the farm-house was
deserted, and taken a good look at it as it hung
from a rafter and well out of reach. It was
still unwrapped, but the brown paper was torn
in one place, and through the hole the little girl
had seen a smooth, round red stick. It was a
wheel-spoke.</p>

<p>Her sixth-and-a-half birthday was not far off,
and she had waited for its coming as patiently
as she could, in the meantime working secretly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
on harnesses for the dogs, who had resigned
themselves good-naturedly to much measuring.
Now, on the very eve of her happiness, she was
to be deprived of the yearned-for wagon.</p>

<p>Crouching in the corn-field, she grieved away
the long day. Dinner-time came, and all the
corn-stalk shadows pointed significantly toward
the carnelian bluff; then they slowly shifted
around to the eastward and grew very long;
and at last commingled and were blotted out by
the descending gloom that infolded the little
girl.</p>

<p>Lying upon her back, she looked up at the
sky, that with the gathering darkness of the
warm summer night disclosed its twinkling
stars, and wished that she could suddenly die
out there in the field in some mysterious way,
so that there might be much self-condemning
woe at the farm-house when they found her,
cold and still. And she could not refrain from
weeping with sheer pity for herself. After
pondering for a while on the sad picture of her
untimely death, she changed to one of great
deeds and happiness, wealth and renown, in
some far-off land toward which she was half
determined to set out. But this delightful
dream was rudely broken into.</p>

<p>A long blast from the cow-horn sounded
through the quiet night and echoed itself
against the bluff. The little girl sat up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
looked toward the house through the dark aisles
of the corn.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming," she said, speaking out
loud in a voice that broke as she ended, "I'm
going to stay here and <i>starve</i> to death!"</p>

<p>Once more the cow-horn blew, and this time
the call was more prolonged and commanding
in tone. It brought the little girl to her feet,
and she hunted up her hat and put it on. Then,
as two short, peremptory blasts rang out, she
started toward home.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning she dressed hurriedly and got
to the sitting-room as quickly as she could.
But there was no bright red wagon standing
bravely in wait for her as she entered; there
was nothing under her breakfast plate, even,
when she turned it over. She ate her grits and
milk in silence, choking a little when she swallowed,
and, as soon as she could, rushed away
to the corn-crib to see if the brown-paper package
were still there.</p>

<p>It was gone!</p>

<p>Then she knew that her big brothers had sent
it away.</p>

<p>She crept back to the house and climbed the
ladder to the attic, where she meant to hide
and mourn alone. But no sooner had she
gained her feet beneath the peaked roof, than
she saw what she had been seeking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It hung by its scarlet tongue from a beam,
flanked on one side by the paper of sage that
was being saved to season the holiday turkeys,
and on the other by the bag that held the
trimmings of the Yule-tree. And the little girl,
sitting tearfully beneath it, tried to count on
her fingers the days that must pass before
Christmas.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>TWICE IN JEOPARDY</h3>


<div class='cap'>COOL and sparkling after its morning rain-bath,
and showing along its green ridges
those first, faint signs of yellow that foretell
a coming ripeness, the grass-mantled prairie
lay beneath the warm noon sun. The little
girl, cantering over it toward the sod shanty
on the farther river bluffs, frightened the trilling
meadow-larks, as she passed, from their
perch on the dripping sunflowers, and scattered
the drops on the wild wheat-blades with the
hoofs of her blind black pony.</div>

<p>The storm had wept so copiously upon the
fading plains that the furrows, turned along the
edge of the broad wheat-field to check fires, ran
full and swift down the gentle slope that the
little girl was crossing and almost kept pace
with her pony. Every hollow in her path was
filled to the brim, and the chain of sloughs to
the south, now resounding with the joyous
quacks of bluewings and mallards, were swelling
their waters with the feeding of countless
streams. And the drenched ground, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
flowers bent their clean faces as if worn with
the heavy downpour, sent up that grateful essence
that follows in the wake of a shower.</p>

<p>The blind, black pony felt the new life in the
springy turf and the fresh air and flirted his
unshod heels dangerously near to a tracking
wolf-dog as he splashed through runlet and
pool. <i>Pluff-et-y-pluff, pluff-et-y-pluff, pluff-et-y-pluff</i>,
he drummed softly, and the panting
hound, muzzle down, followed with a soft <i>swish,
swish</i>. But to the little girl, thinking of the
bounty for gopher brushes that her big brothers
had offered her the day before, the galloping
echoed a different song: <i>A-cent-for-a-tail,
a-cent-for-a-tail, a-cent-for-a-tail</i>, it sang in her
ears, till she struck the pony a welt on the flanks
with the ends of her long rope reins, and jerked
his head impatiently toward the shallow ford
that led to the home of the Swede boy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning before, the little girl's mother
and the three big brothers had held an indignation
meeting in the timothy meadow, which,
once the choicest bit of hay land on the farm,
was now so thickly strewn with wide, brown
gopher-mounds, that the little girl, with a good
running start down the barren corn strip, could
cross it without touching a spear of grass, by
bopping from one hillock to another. But while
this amused her very much, for she pretended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that the knolls were muskrat houses in a deep,
deep slough, it only enraged her mother and
the big brothers. For the gray gophers had
intrenched themselves so well in the timothy,
and had thrown up such damaging earthworks,
that only a scythe could save what little
hay remained; and they had not only taken
into their burrows&mdash;as had been discovered
the week before&mdash;all the freshly dropped seed
from the barren corn strip, but had dug up
kernels all over the field when they were sprouting
into stalks.</p>

<p>The meadow had lain fallow the summer
before, and had served no further use than the
grazing of some picketed cows. Then, one
parching July day it had been cut, to kill the
thistles and pigweed that overran it, and in the
following May had been plowed, dragged, and
sown to wild timothy. The few mounds dotting
it had been turned under with the belief that,
between the fallow and the new plowing, the
gophers would be driven out. Instead, they
had kept to their burrows and, all in good time,
had tripled their number.</p>

<p>So, as the little girl's mother and the big
brothers stood on the edge of the timothy and
viewed the concave stretch that should have
showed green and waving from its rim to the
boggy center, they planned the destruction of
the rodents, and declared that if any escaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
death by poison, the little girl should snare
them and receive a cent for each tail.</p>

<p>When her mother's calico slat-sunbonnet
and the big hats of her big brothers had bobbed
out of sight across the corn, the little girl sat
down upon a hillock and counted gophers.
But there were so many and they ran about so
much that she could not keep track of them;
so she gave it up soon and began to think over
all the things she would buy from the thick catalogue
with the money she would get when she
had snared a great number.</p>

<p>And she was still sitting there, watching the
gophers covetously, when she saw the eldest
brother returning. He had a salmon-can full
of poisoned wheat in one hand, and when he
reached the meadow he made a circuit and left
a pinch of grain at the mouths of a score of
burrows, where the greedy animals could find
it and cram it into their cheek-pouches, and
then crawl into their holes to die. When he
had distributed all the grain, he threw the
salmon-can away, wiped his fingers on his overalls,
and started for the watermelon patch.</p>

<p>The little girl had silently withdrawn into
the corn-field at his approach, but now she came
out and, after satisfying herself that he was out
of sight, picked up the can and also made a
circuit of the meadow. Strangely enough, she
stopped at the very burrows he had visited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
When she was done, she went to the boggy center,
found a deep cow track that was half full
of water, and carefully emptied the can into it.
Then she took it back to where the eldest brother
had thrown it, and, with a look toward the
watermelon patch, went home.</p>

<p>On his way back to the farm-house, the eldest
brother paused in the timothy to see if the gophers
had eaten of the poisoned grain. He
was delighted to find, on going from hill to
hill, that not a single kernel was visible! He
imparted the good news to the family at the
dinner-table, and it was received with rejoicing.
The little girl alone was silent. But, doubtless,
she had not heard what he said, for she was
intent upon a huge piece of dried-prune cobbler.</p>

<p>That afternoon she went out to the barn to
get some hair for a slipping-noose. Kate, the
raw-boned cultivator horse, standing idle in
her stall, turned her head and nickered when
she heard the door creak open, expecting a
nibble of sugar-bread. But the little girl had
nothing for her. Instead, she rolled a dry-goods
box into an adjoining stall, climbed upon it, and,
reaching over the rough board side, got hold
of Kate's long black tail.</p>

<p>The mare flattened her ears back, stamped
crossly, and swayed her hind quarters against
the opposite partition. But the little girl only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
clung the tighter and, unmindful in her security,
chose and pulled out a dozen of the longest
hairs she could find. Then, jumping down,
she arranged them, ends together, hooked them
over a nail at their center, and plaited them.
And when she had tied a piece of stout, dark
string to the end of the braid, she slipped it
through the hair loop. The next moment, with
a stick in one hand and the snare in the other,
she started happily for the meadow.</p>

<p>When she reached it, saucy <i>chur-r-rs</i> from all
over the timothy announced her. And as she
paused on its edge to decide which burrow
she would attack first, a dozen gophers sat up
on their haunches to look at her, or frisked
gaily from mound to mound.</p>

<p>She caught sight of a gray back at a near-by
hole, and, running forward, chased the animal
out of sight, stooped and carefully arranged
the noose around the opening, and, after covering
it with dirt, straightened the string to its
full length. Then she crept back noiselessly
to the hole to take a last peep before she threw
herself down flat upon her stomach, grasped
the end of the string, and lay very still.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no movement at the
burrow. But soon the tip end of a gopher's
nose appeared, the whiskers moving inquiringly,
and disappeared. When it came again,
the little girl whistled a note softly, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nose came out so far that two sharp black
eyes showed. The eyes saw her, too, and the
gopher, growing bolder and more inquisitive,
raised himself higher on his fore paws to take
a better look. Presently all of his white throat
was visible, and the little girl knew that it was
time to act. With one quick, vigorous jerk of
her extended right arm, she tightened the loop
around him. And, amid a whirl of dirt, gray
tail, and tawny back, the gopher was pulled out
into the timothy.</p>

<p>The little girl sat upon her knees and looked
at him. Her heart was beating wildly, and she
was almost as scared as the panting creature
at the end of her string. He held the snare
taut as he crouched in a bunch of grass and
watched her. Finally, she pulled at it a little.
It brought him toward her, reluctantly sliding
along on his feet, which he braced stiffly. Then,
as she pulled again, he began to tug madly, and
clattered in alarm.</p>

<p>"<i>Seek&mdash;seek!</i>" he cried, twisting and turning
his lithe body; "<i>seek&mdash;seek&mdash;seek!</i>" The
next instant he took the string into his mouth
and bit it ferociously.</p>

<p>The little girl paled at the sight, and arose
trembling to her feet. This shortened the
snare, and the gopher came nearer, tumbling
over and over through the grass. Remembering
her stick, the little girl backed slowly toward it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
not taking her eyes off him for an instant.
But, as she retreated, the string tightened again,
and the gopher advanced as before. The little
girl, still too far from the stick, trembled more
than ever at his wild cries, and her hand shook
so that she could hardly hold the snare. He
was attacking it with all his might, bounding
into the air and, blindly fearless in his danger,
coming toward her faster than she could step
backward.</p>

<p>A moment she paused, shaking her apron to
try to scare him. But as, hissing and fighting,
he rolled against her bare feet, she dropped
the string, turned her face from the meadow&mdash;and
fled!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> Sunday afternoon the Swede boy came
to the farm-house and, squatting opposite the
little girl as she sat enthroned upon the lounge
in all the glory of a stiff Turkey-red dress, eyed
her furtively while her mother read aloud the
story of Mazeppa. His pale eyes, under their
heavy white brows, never wavered from her
face, even during the most stirring danger to
the Cossack chief. Upon these occasions the
little girl's mind wandered, too; for the tale of
bravery recalled the colonel's son at the army
post, the pride of the troop, who, in campaign
hat, yellow-striped trousers, and snug, bright-buttoned
coat, was a sturdy military figure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
And had the Swede boy known it, he was less
to her than a cockle-bur in her blind black
pony's tail.</p>

<p>But youth is fickle and the reservation was
far. So, when the rain was over next morning,
she ran to the barn, bridled her horse,
climbed from the manger to his back, and,
lying flat to escape the top casing of the door,
went out of the stable toward the Swede shanty
at a run. Down deep in the long, narrow, jack-knife
pocket of her apron lay a new gopher
snare, culled, as before, from the tail of the
cultivator mare.</p>

<p>As she scoured across the prairie, her hair
whipping her shoulders and her skirts fluttering
gaily, the last few clouds in the sky, white and
almost empty, dispersed tearfully above the distant
forks of the Vermillion. And when the river
was reached and forded, and the steep bank
climbed on the other side, a drying wind that
had sprung up promised, with the sun, to prepare
the timothy for that afternoon's snaring.</p>

<p>The Swede boy listened silently while the
little girl unfolded her plan, and, after she had
finished, waited a long time before speaking.
His pale eyes looked thoughtfully at the ground,
and the little girl, still mounted on her pony,
could not see whether or not they approved of
the scheme.</p>

<p>"Who gates th' mownay?" he asked at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The little girl hesitated before answering,
struggling with greed.</p>

<p>"Bofe of us?" she faltered.</p>

<p>The Swede boy grunted.</p>

<p>"You catch 'em and kill 'em," said the little
girl, "and I'll snip off their tails. 'Cause my
biggest brother says gray gophers don't worry
no more 'bout losin' their tails than tadpoles
do."</p>

<p>He grunted again, and the little girl, eager
and impatient, turned the blind black pony
about in circles.</p>

<p>"Ay catch 'em, ay kill 'em," the Swede boy
said finally. There was a significant tone in
his voice, and a gleam in the pale eyes under
the tow hair. "An' yo' gate th' mownay," he
added.</p>

<p>They were on the edge of the timothy meadow
as soon as the pony, with his double load,
could cover the distance. And while the little
girl tied the horse to a big stone on the slope
of the carnelian bluff, the Swede boy hastened
to a gopher-hole and fixed the noose about it.
A moment later, when she came stealthily running
up behind him, he was already flat upon
the ground and waiting.</p>

<p>It was not long before the gopher poked his
nose out to see if his pursuer was near, and,
catching sight of a ragged felt hat just above
a clump of pigweed, stood up to investigate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The next instant the Swede boy had him and,
springing to his feet, cast a triumphant look
behind. But what was his amazement to see
the little girl, bareheaded, fast disappearing
through the corn!</p>

<p>When she came slowly back, the Swede boy
was again stretched upon his stomach, and
watching a hole nearer the center of the meadow.
The little girl did not follow him, but
stayed on the rim and pityingly viewed the
limp gopher that lay, with eyes half closed,
breast still, and tail thin and lifeless.</p>

<p>"Poor fing!" she said sympathetically, "it's
'cause you stealed the corn."</p>

<p>Then she opened his mouth with the butt end
of her willow riding-switch, to find out what
he had in his cheek-pouches. An onion and
a few marrowfat peas rolled out, and the little
girl, kneeling beside him, eyed him sternly.</p>

<p>"And so," she said, waving her hand toward
the barren strip, "after pickin' up all that corn,
you gophers have to go a-snoopin' round the
veg'table patch!"</p>

<p>She left him and went on to the corn-marker,
his tail, taken in righteous wrath, bearing her
jack-knife company in the long, narrow pocket
of her apron. But when she had sat down
musingly, her chin in her hands, a strange
thing happened to the dead gopher on the meadow
rim. He moved a little, slowly unclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
his eyes, raised his head, and looked about; and,
unseen by the Swede boy and the little girl,
crawled away, through the clods that had only
stunned him, to the corn-field, where, with many
a cross <i>seek</i>, he nursed the hairy stump that
henceforth was to serve him for a tail.</p>

<p>Dinnerless, but forgetful of hunger in the
sport of capture, the little girl and the Swede
boy stayed on. Once, during the afternoon, a
gopher stopped their work by getting away with
the snare and leaving them only half of the
string. But the blind black pony good-naturedly
furnished enough wiry strands for another
slipping-noose, and the hunt went on.</p>

<p>On their way to the farm-house at sundown,
they passed the spot where the Swede boy had
left his first capture, but failed to find him anywhere.</p>

<p>"Why, he's runned away!" exclaimed the
little girl.</p>

<p>The Swede boy shook his head. "Noa; ay
keel hame weeth a clode," he said, "an' a bole-snake
gote hame."</p>

<p>They had many a stout noose stolen during
the days that followed. But the Swede boy
snared plenty of gray gophers, and they all
shared the fate of the first one,&mdash;lost their
tails and were left to lie on the edge of the
ruined meadow. When the spot was visited
afterward, it was generally found that they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
disappeared. But this did not trouble the little
girl, for she wisely concluded that the bull-snakes
were having a fat time of it.</p>

<p>The night before the three big brothers left
with the thrashers, the string of gopher-tails
was so long that she brought it into the kitchen
and gave it proudly to the eldest brother to
count. Then it was put into a twist of hay and
shoved into the cook-stove.</p>

<p>"Goin' to give some of them pennies to th'
Swede?" asked the youngest brother as the little
girl sat down at the table and began to add
up her earnings.</p>

<p>She flushed, but did not answer.</p>

<p>"Naw," said the eldest brother. "Why, th'
Swede's not catchin' gophers for money; he's
doin' it for love."</p>

<p>The little girl gathered up her pennies angrily
and went to her room. But, next morning,
when the Swede boy's whistle sounded from
the meadow, she mounted her pony and went
down. For the biggest brother had whispered
to her this word of philosophy: "Might jus' as
well get th' game with th' name."</p>

<p>For several nights after the departure of the
big brothers, the little girl came home radiant,
brushes dangling from her apron ruffle like
scalps. Then, one evening, when four catches
should have made her happy, she ate her supper
with a sad and puzzled face, and afterward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
added only <i>two</i> tails to her string. Her mother,
seeing that something was troubling her, inquired
what it was; but, on hearing the story,
went into such a hearty fit of laughter that the
little girl's feelings were hurt very much, and
she went to bed on the instant. She did not
broach the subject again. But while the two
weeks of her big brothers' absence were passing,
she was often dejected.</p>

<p>After supper, the first night of their return,
when the benches were still drawn up around
the table, and the big brothers, tired with their
long ride, were pulling at their corn-cob pipes,
the little girl went up to the eldest and touched
him timidly on the arm.</p>

<p>"Well, youngster," he said, "how many gophers
have you snared since we've been gone?"</p>

<p>The little girl got red suddenly, and hesitated
before she spoke. "Sixty," she answered,
half under her breath.</p>

<p>The biggest brother took his pipe out of his
mouth in mock astonishment. "Sixty!" he exclaimed.
"Why, geewhitaker! you'll break
the bank if you don't look out!"</p>

<p>The eldest brother put his hand into his
pocket and took out some change. "Get the
string," he said, "and here's your money."</p>

<p>The little girl looked at the coins mournfully,
and then around the circle, and stepped back
a few paces. "You won't b'lieve me when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
see it," she said. She went out and came back
presently, holding up the tails.</p>

<p>The eldest brother took them out of her hand,
and she stood silently by while he counted them.
When he had finished, he looked at her crossly.
"Sixty!" he sneered. "You haven't caught
no such thing! Here's only twenty." He
waved the brushes in the air, and the little girl
trembled visibly. "Did you think I'd pay you
for sixty," he continued, "when you ain't got
the tails to show for 'em?"</p>

<p>The little girl trembled more than ever.
"Honest," she said; "honest! We caught
sixty&mdash;we did, truly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where are their tails, then? where are their
tails?" asked the eldest brother, impatiently,
shaking the string so violently that some of the
brushes fell off. "You <i>say</i> you did&mdash;<i>but what
have you got to show for 'em</i>?"</p>

<p>The little girl came closer, her eyes wide and
earnest. She was breathing hard and she
lowered her voice as she answered.</p>

<p>"True as cross my heart to die," she said,
"we caught sixty; but this was all the string
I could get. 'Cause&mdash;'cause&mdash;there's a new
kind of gophers in the timothy meadow,&mdash;<i>and
they ain't got tails!</i>"</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>A HARVEST WEDDING</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE wedding of one of the Dutchman's
seven stout daughters to a young farmer
who lived in a dugout on the West Fork was
an event in the little girl's life only second in
importance to the christening. Two trips to
Yankton on the wheat-wagon with the biggest
brother shrank into insignificance before it,
and she looked forward to its celebration so
anxiously that time dragged as slowly as a
week before Christmas.</div>

<p>The morning of the notable day she was
unable to eat anything through sheer excitement.
She passed the hours after breakfast
in restless riding over the barley stubble, where
the sheep, led by a black bell-wether who
sought the fields because they were forbidden
ground, were mincing and picking their way.
At eleven she happily welcomed a gallop to the
farthest end of the farm to carry doughnuts
and ginger-beer to the big brothers. At
dinner-time her appetite was again poor, but
later, after making enough hay-twists for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mother's baking, she scraped the cake-batter
dish clean and partook freely of several yards
of red apple peelings.</p>

<p>The big brothers came in early from the
fields to rest and get ready, and, one by one,
spent half an hour in the kitchen, where the big
wooden wash-tub held the center of the room.
When it came time for the little girl to take
a bath, the kitchen floor looked like a duck
pond, for the tub was almost floating, and the
well outside was noticeably low. At sunset
the family sat down to a supper suggestive of
the wedding feast to come. But though there
were toothsome sandwiches on the table and
cream popovers, not to speak of a heaping dish
of watermelon sweet-pickles, the little girl
again did not feel like eating, and only nibbled
at a piece of raisin-pie when her mother, not
realizing how satisfying the batter and peelings
had been, threatened her with staying at
home. After supper the big brothers hitched
the gray team to the light wagon, fastened
up the chicken-coops, latched the barn door
and chained the dogs; and, having finished the
chores, blacked each other's boots, brushed
their hair slick with water, changed their
clothes and resigned themselves to their mother,
who put the last touches to their collars
and ties. Then, just as a faint bugle-call,
sounding the advance, was heard from across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the prairie to the west, the family climbed into
the wagon.</p>

<p>On the trip down, the eldest and youngest
brothers sat in front and drove. Their mother
and the biggest brother occupied the hind seat
and looked after the piccalilli and pies, which
they held on their laps. So the little girl had
to content herself with staying in the back of
the wagon on an armful of hay and letting
her feet dangle out behind. As the team
trotted south over the rough path that, at the
school-house, joined another leading to the
Dutchman's, she clung to the side boards in impatient
silence, her eyes turned across the
sloughs toward the Vermilion, where, through
the starlight, were coming the chaplain, some
troopers, and the colonel's son.</p>

<p>It was a still night, and the family could hear
other wagons approaching from various directions,
the distant whinnying of ponies traveling
singly, the barking of the Dutchman's
dogs, and the thudding gallop of the nearing
cavalry mounts; and when they arrived the
same shouts that greeted them welcomed a
score of their neighbors and the dusty army
men.</p>

<p>The moments that followed were memorable
ones to the little girl. Standing by on tiptoe,
with only the neighbor woman between her
and the colonel's son, she saw the chaplain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
unite the Dutchman's daughter and the young
farmer. The ceremony took place in the yard,
so that all might witness it, and the biggest
brother held the lantern by which the chaplain
read from his prayer-book. The guests gathered
about quietly, and listened reverently to the
service and to the prayer for health and happiness
in the dugout home on the Fork. And
when the kissing, handshaking, and congratulations
were over, they moved across the yard
to the kitchen door, where they drank hearty
toasts to the bride, in coffee-cups foaming high
with beer. Then the married men took their
wives, and the unmarried, their sweethearts,
and went into the house to open the party.</p>

<p>The Dutchman's habitation was different
from his neighbors' homes. One roof sheltered
his family, his oxen and his cows, his harvested
crops, his poultry and his pigs. It was a shanty
roof, and it covered a long, sod building that
began, at the river end, with the sitting-room,
continued through the bedroom, the kitchen,
the granary, the stable, and the chicken-coop,
and was completed by the pig-house. The
Dutchman, his wife, and their daughters could
go back and forth from the best room to the
beasts without leaving its cover. So, no matter
how deep the snow was, the cattle never lacked
for fodder, the hens for feed, or the hogs for
their mash, a boiler of which, sour and fumy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cooked winter and summer upon the kitchen
stove; and, when the fiercest of blizzards was
blowing, the family were in no danger of getting
lost between the house and the barn.</p>

<p>The three rooms of the building that were
nearest the Vermilion, though given different
names, were really all bedrooms. A high four-poster
of unplaned boards stood against the
low back wall of the sitting-room, beneath the
rack that held the Dutchman's pipes; the
sleeping-room, which the four eldest children
occupied, held two smaller beds; and in the
kitchen&mdash;where the family ate their breakfasts
of coffee-cake and barley-coffee, their dinners
of souse and vegetables and hard bread broken
into a pan of clabbered milk, and supped, without
plates, around a deep bowl of stew&mdash;was
a wide couch that belonged to the youngest
three.</p>

<p>But on the night of the wedding the first
two rooms were empty, except for benches, the
beds having been taken down early in the day
and piled up beside the hay-stacks back of the
stable. The couch in the kitchen was left in
its place, however, and was covered from head
to foot with babies.</p>

<p>The house was lighted by barn lanterns, hung
out of the way under the shingles at the upper
ends of the bare, sloping roof-joists, and their
dull flames, that leaped and dipped with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
moving feet beneath them, shone upon walls
clean and bright in a fresh layer of newspapers,
and revealed, to whomever cast a look
upward, the parcels of herbs, seeds, and sewing
thrust here and there in handy crevices of
the brown, cobwebbed ceiling.</p>

<p>The Dutchman's neighbors crowded the
rooms to the doors. In the kitchen were the
older women, keeping watch over the couch
and, at the same time, with busy clatter in a
half-dozen tongues, unwrapping the edibles
brought for the wedding supper. In the doorway
between the other rooms sat the eldest
brother playing his fiddle, the Irishman twanging
a jews'-harp, and "Frenchy" with the
bones; and on each side of them danced the
guests.</p>

<p>The newly made bride and her husband led
the quadrille in the sitting-room, opposite a
trooper and the neighbor woman; the Swede
had as his partner the new teacher, a young
lady from St. Paul; and the biggest brother
had his mother. Above them, as they promenaded,
balanced, and swung, waved the black
felt hat that the Dutchman had worn when he
took his long trip over the prairie to invite
them. Each family he visited had pinned a
ribbon to its rim; and now it swayed back and
forth, a gay and varicolored challenge to the
hands reached out to grasp it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The army chaplain was in the next room;
and, as the quadrille closed in a roistering
polka and a waltz struck up, he clapped in time
to the couples that were circling before him,
their hands on each other's shoulders, and their
voices joining merrily with the music:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"In Lauterbach hab' ich mein Strumf verlor'n,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Und ohne Strumf geh' ich nicht heim;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ich gehe doch wieder zu Lauterbach hin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Und kauf' mir ein Strumf f&uuml;r mein Bein."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Now and then a couple drew aside and sat
down a moment to rest. But soon they were
back on the floor again, whirling and laughing
and stamping their feet, and raising clouds of
dust from the rough plank floors to their scarlet
faces.</div>

<p>Out of doors there was less noise, but no lack
of fun. Smudge fires burned in a wide circle
about the house to repel the hungry mosquitos
that, with high, monotonous battle-songs,
stormed the smoky barrier between them and
the inner circle of horses and oxen feeding
from wagon-boxes. Nearer the building, and
set about the carefully raked yard on barrels
and boxes, were Jack-o'-lanterns made of
pumpkins, that gave out the uncertain, flickering
light of tallow dips through their goggle-eyes
and grinning mouths.</p>

<p>In and out among the wagons, fires, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
lanterns the children were playing hide-and-go-seek,
screaming with excitement as they
scampered in every direction to secrete themselves,
or lying still and breathless as the boy
who was "it" hunted them cautiously, with
one eye searching for moving shadows and the
other fixed upon the wagon-wheel that was the
goal. On being sent out of the house to give
the dancers room, the boys had raised a joyous
clamor over their banishment, and begun a
game of crack-the-whip; while the girls, not
wishing to soil their clothes, had walked to and
fro in front of the house, with their arms
around each other, and watched the dancing.
But when the Swede boy, who was chosen for
the snapper, was so worn and breathless with
being popped from the end of the rushing line
that he could run no longer, boys and girls had
joined in playing tag and blindman's-buff and,
afterward, hide-and-go-seek.</p>

<p>The little girl was with them. But, so far,
in spite of her white dress, which made her an
easy prey, she had not been caught. The boys
who had taken their turns at the wheel had
caught other boys whom she did not know; and
had always managed to find and, with much
struggling, kiss the particular girls they favored.
No matter how conspicuously she had
hidden, they had always passed her by. As a
result, after two or three disappointments, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
had not taken the trouble of running to cover,
but had either lingered just within the sitting-room
to watch the dancing, or hung wistfully
about the yard, somewhere near the colonel's
son.</p>

<p>"Frenchy's" brother was now guarding the
goal, and the little girl was ambushed behind
the very straw-pile that concealed the colonel's
son. It was an occasion that she had looked
forward to and secretly brought to pass, yet, as
she knelt close beside him, she could not think
of one of the polite things she had planned to
say to him that night. Their proximity struck
her dumb, while he was silent through fear of
being discovered. So they cowered together,
speechless and restive, until the Swede boy
tore by in an unsuccessful race for the wagon-wheel.
Then the colonel's son darted out from
behind the straw, and she remained regretfully
looking after his blue-clad form.</p>

<p>All at once her meditations were rudely
interrupted. "Frenchy's" brother, skulking
here and there on the lookout for a bright, telltale
apron, came round the pile and pounced
upon her. "Forfeet! forfeet!" he cried, dragging
her out into the middle of the yard.</p>

<p>She tried to pull away from him, and twisted
her head so that her face was out of reach.
"You stop," she cried hotly; "you jus' stop!"</p>

<p>The struggle was sweet to him, however, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he only laughed at her angry commands and
fought harder than ever for his due, striving
at every turn to pin her arms down so that she
could not resist. The boys ran up to urge him
on, and the girls hopped up and down in their
enjoyment of the scuffle.</p>

<p>But he was not able to win in the contest.
The little girl was a match for him. What she
lacked in strength she made up in nimbleness,
and she stood her ground fiercely, wrestling on
until, with a quick, furious wrench, she freed
herself from his hold and bolted toward the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Frenchy's" brother pursued her. But,
once inside, she was safe, for he dared not enter
and scramble across the couch to where she
had sought refuge by a window. So he turned
back toward the goal. "I get you yet," he
shouted, wiping his damp face on his shirt
sleeve.</p>

<p>The other children gathered about him and
taunted him with his failure. To right himself
in their eyes he set after one of the Dutchman's
girls, who shook off her wooden shoes and fled
frantically in circles to evade him. But he
succeeded in catching her and taking a forfeit
from one of her sun-bleached braids, after
which he went to the wagon and sat down on
the tongue to rest.</p>

<p>The game went on. It was the Swede boy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
turn at the goal, and he put his hands over his
face and began to count as the children scattered.
"Tane, twanety, thirty, forty, feefty,"
he chanted, "seexty, saventy, eighty." As he
told the numbers he stealthily watched the
kitchen window where the little girl stood.</p>

<p>The neighbor woman's boy, who was in hiding
under the wagon and almost at his feet, saw
him peeking through his fingers and jumped
out to denounce him. "King's ex, king's ex!"
he cried, holding up one hand. "It's no fair;
he's looking."</p>

<p>"Ay bane note," declared the Swede boy,
stoutly, wheeling about; "yo late may alone."</p>

<p>"You are, too," persisted the other, springing
away to hide again.</p>

<p>The Swede boy once more resumed his chanting,
and the little girl, as she leaned from her
vantage-point to listen, wished that she might
return to the yard and take part in the game.
But "Frenchy's" brother, though tired with
his struggles, was still sitting menacingly on
the wagon tongue, and she dared not leave her
cover.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sight of a slat sunbonnet, hanging
on a nail beside her, suggested a means of
circumventing him. She took it down and put
it on, tying the strings under her chin in a hard
double knot. The long, stiff pasteboard slats
buried her face completely, and nobody but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Luffree, with his sharp muzzle, could have
reached her cheeks to kiss them. So she sallied
bravely into the yard.</p>

<p>The Swede boy had been counting slowly in
the hope that she would hide, and when he saw
her approaching he paused a moment, expecting
"Frenchy's" brother to renew the attack.
But the figure on the tongue never moved, even
when the little girl, with a saucy swish of her
skirts, paused daringly near it. So he sang out
his last call:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Boshel of wheat, boshel of raye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who ain't radey, holer 'Ay.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I," shouted the little girl, whisking triumphantly
away, and the Swede boy began to
count again.</p>

<p>She entered the house, going in at the sitting-room.
He followed her movements as she
threaded her way through the dancers toward
the empty granary, and saw her sunbonnet
pass the bedroom window and the open
kitchen door. Then once more he sent out
the last call. This time there was no response.
So, after a hasty examination of the wagon, he
began to creep about with an impressive show
of hunting.</p>

<p>Often he came upon a new calico dress trailing
in a dusty place, but passed its wearer by
as if he had not seen her. He surprised the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
colonel's son curled up in a box beneath a
Jack-o'-lantern, and distanced him to the
wagon. Then he went on searching for a girl,
and the boys, clustered about the wheel,
watched him as he sneaked through the yard.
Finally, when he judged that enough time had
passed to warrant it, he made a wider search
that brought him close to the granary door.</p>

<p>His courage almost failed him as he passed
in front of it, and he was glad when the delighted
squeals of two girls, who were running
toward the goal, gave him an excuse to delay
his entrance. But when the girls had tapped
the wheel, he bounded back and, spurring himself
on, stepped within the dark room, where,
in a far corner, he caught a faint glint of white.</p>

<p>He walked toward it timidly. It moved, and
he stood still. "Yo there?" he asked, at last,
his throat so dry that he could scarcely find the
words. A subdued giggle answered him. He
recalled how kind and comrade-like she had
been to him three months before when they had
caught gophers together, and his spirits rose.
"Yo there?" he asked again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came from her corner and attempted
to pass him. Emboldened by the darkness,
he put out his arms and stopped her, and
she laughed gaily up at him. He laughed shyly
back and dropped her arms. She made no
effort to get away. He stood still, awkwardly
cracking his knuckles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you fight!" she demanded. He
did not reply, but shuffled his feet and cracked
his knuckles harder than ever. The music of
a waltz floated in to them over the babble of the
kitchen, and he turned his head that way as if
to listen. As he did so she crept past him, her
eyes sparkling with fun from the depths of the
bonnet. When he turned back to look at her,
she was gone.</p>

<p>He followed her out and paid no attention to
the jeering inquiries of the other children.
And as the colonel's son began to count from
the wagon-wheel he walked slowly past the
teams and smudges, and across a strip of backfire
beyond, to the high, dry grass, where he
lay on his back for the rest of the evening,
looking sadly up at the stars.</p>

<p>The little girl sought a hiding-place, too, behind
a hay-stack on the other side of the house.
The colonel's son had seen her run that way,
and as he sounded the final challenge his voice
had a victorious ring. He began a second
mock hunt. But it was a short one, for, fearful
that he might stumble upon one of the Dutchman's
younger brood, he first penetrated the
outer darkness to find a boy, and then ran
round the house in the direction taken by the
little girl.</p>

<p>He came upon her unexpectedly as he circled
a stack. She was crouching in plain sight
against the hay, her face still hidden in the recesses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the bonnet. He rushed up to her and
took her by the shoulders. "I've got you!"
he said, but so low that the neighbor woman's
daughter, who was just a few steps away behind
a fanning-mill, could scarcely hear him.</p>

<p>"Y-e-e-s," stammered the little girl. She
drew back and looked down, all her assurance
supplanted by a wild desire to get away.</p>

<p>"Going to let me have my forfeit?" he whispered,
shaking her a little.</p>

<p>The sunbonnet drooped until its wide cape
stood up stiffly above her curls. "I hate that
old French boy," she said.</p>

<p>The colonel's son moved closer, and a wisp
of brittle grass in her hands crackled in a
double grasp. She glanced up at him swiftly,
as she felt his touch, and this time there was a
nearing of the white frock to the suit of blue.
"Well,&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;you've got t'," she added.</p>

<p>But the colonel's son, as he bent over her with
all the gallantry of his nine years, had to learn
by experience what "Frenchy's" brother had
divined at a glance: the sunbonnet was in the
way.</p>

<p>He was equal to the emergency, however, and
hesitated only for a moment. Then he put his
hand into his trousers pocket and took out his
clasp-knife. He could hear some one at the goal
calling him, and there was a rattle of dishes in
the house, where the music had ceased for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
moment, that told him the plates were being
passed for supper. He knew that in a moment
either the chaplain or the boys would be searching
for him.</p>

<p>She heard the calls and clatter, too; yet she
did not move except to raise her head until the
bonnet strings were in plain sight under her
dimpled chin. When he saw them, he straightened
his knife out with a click and leaned once
more toward her.</p>

<p>The fiddle was playing the opening strains
of the supper dance now, and a hundred voices
were singing with it; so the neighbor woman's
daughter, who had been peering from behind
the fanning-mill, hurried away to the house.
And thus it came about that no one but a
vagrant night-hawk, perched high on the top
of the stack, remained near enough to hear the
sawing sound of a dull knife-blade, making its
way through cloth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early morning hours, as the gray team
jogged homeward past the deserted school-house,
the big brothers and their mother discussed
the wedding, the dancing, and the supper.
But the little girl, snugly wrapped in a
quilt on the hay behind, lay still and silent, and
only smiled when the night breeze from the
west bore to her ear the clear notes of the departing
bugle blowing a sweet retreat.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>THE PRICE OF CONVALESCENCE</h3>


<div class='cap'>EVERY morning a cloud appeared in the
east, rushed westward across the northern
sky, and vanished beyond the "Jim."
Every afternoon it came up in the west again,
swept back toward the east, and went out of
sight in the Big Sioux. If a herd chanced to be
grazing too near its path as it approached,
they were scattered right and left in wild confusion
by a shrill <i>toot</i>! <i>toot</i>! that could be heard
at the farm-house. But when the way was
clear the cloud traveled swiftly and silently,
stringing itself, on sunny days, to a low white
ribbon, or, if the air was damp and the heavens
were gray, separating itself, from river
to river, into many dark coughs of dense, high-sailing
smoke.</div>

<p>For three months it had been crossing the
plains as regularly as the sun itself. Before
that it had loitered, attended, so the biggest
brother said, by a great company of rough men
carrying shovels and picks. It was this company,
stray members of which, worn and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
grimy, had visited the farm-house now and
then and talked in broad brogue, that had kept
the little girl and the herd south of the reservation
road throughout the early spring; and it
was not until the men had dispersed and the
cloud had begun its daily trips from horizon
to horizon that she was permitted to ride northward
on the pinto to see it go by.</p>

<p>The youngest brother went with her,
mounted upon a skittish, bald-faced pony, and
they halted together, near the low embankment
that divided the prairie, to wait for the engine.
But when it hurtled past, a screaming thing
of iron and flying sparks, both the pinto and
the pony, despite their riders' curbing, retreated
so precipitately from the track that
neither she nor the youngest brother caught
more than a glimpse of the flying train, for
their mounts ceased running only when the
barn-yard was reached. Then the old mare
came to a stop, blowing and trembling so wildly
that she could scarcely keep her legs, while the
bald-face kicked and snorted about among the
granaries and pens in a perfect paroxysm of
terror.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the pinto
completely lost her fear of the engine, and
would eat quietly near the embankment while
the little girl lay flat on the ties to listen for a
first faint rumble, or waved at the people in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the cars. The flock, too, became so familiar
with the track that they soon had a contempt
for it, a feeling that they retained even after
a dozen of their number had been mangled on
its rails; but the cattle always kept it at a
respectful distance, and only Napoleon ever
showed the train enough hostility to shake his
stubby horns angrily at it or charge toward it
as it shot away over the plains. The herd was
allowed, therefore, to feed along the railroad
in the custody of the little girl.</p>

<p>But now, for nearly three weeks, the Swede
boy had kept guard over the grazing stock, and
the little girl had not even seen the cloud above
the distant train. For she was ill: so ill that
the neighbor woman, who shared the long night
watches beside the canopied bed with the biggest
brother and his mother, shook her head in
the seclusion of the kitchen, and told herself
that the little girl would never be well again.</p>

<p>The family were beginning to have the same
awful thought, and had sent a telegraphic summons
from the new station, ten miles away, to
a physician in Sioux Falls. To them a cloud
far heavier and darker than the engine's breath
was hanging, day and night, over the farm-house,
shutting out all sunshine, hope, and happiness.</p>

<p>One warm afternoon, while the little girl was
riding the cultivator mare up and down in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Indian corn, she had suddenly been seized with
a chill. That night a fever followed, and for a
week she grew steadily worse. Her mother
gave her every home remedy known to be good
for malaria, and at the end of the second week
moved her to the canopied bed, where an ever
waving fan cooled her hot cheeks. It was here,
almost at the end of the third week of her illness,
that the Sioux Falls doctor found her.</p>

<p>She was tossing from side to side, murmuring
in a delirium that had possessed her for
days. Her face showed a scarlet flush against
the white pillow-slip. The biggest brother, who
scarcely left her bedside to rest or eat, was
placing cold cloths upon her forehead and wetting
her lips. White through his tan, he hung
over her in an agony of fear, only lifting his
eyes, now and then, to turn them sorrowfully
upon his mother, seated opposite.</p>

<p>The little girl did not know of the doctor's
arrival. As he hurried into the sitting-room,
she was thinking of the floating cloud. Now
it was pursuing her as she fled from it on a fleet
pony; now it was stooping groundward, a huge,
airy monster, to offer her a cake of ice; again
it was sweeping over her, quenching the deadly
fire that consumed her, and leaving her on the
damp, green bank above the mooring-place of
the bull-boat. She lay very still with her cool
thoughts, her eyes, wide and lustrous, fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
upon the blue canopy overhead. But when,
a moment later, the fever burned more hotly
again, and the cloud changed to a blinding,
blistering steam that enveloped her, she sat
up and fought with her hands, and cried aloud
for the biggest brother.</p>

<p>The doctor caught her wrists and gently put
her back. One glance at her parched lips and
brown tongue had told him what was the matter,
and as he opened a valise and took out some
medicines he answered the inquiring looks of
the family. "Typhoid," he said. "She's a
very sick child. But I think we may be able to
pull her through."</p>

<p>With her mother and the big brothers looking
on mournfully, the first step was taken toward
aiding her. One by one her curls, so long
her mother's pride and care, were snipped off
close to her head; and when at last they lay on
the bed in a newspaper, a little heap of soft,
yellow tangles, there was sobbing all about in
the sitting-room, and even the doctor, accustomed
to sad sights, could not keep the tears
from chasing down his cheeks and into his
brown beard.</p>

<p>She looked pitifully thin and altered, shorn
of her bright halo; yet at once she grew quieter,
and when she was gently lowered into the brimming
wash-tub and then laid between sheets
wrung from cold water, she closed her eyes
gratefully and ceased her outcries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor, collarless and with his shirt-sleeves
rolled up, worked over her all day. The
little girl's mother and the neighbor woman assisted
him, and the big brothers sat on the
bench in front of the house, so as to be within
easy call. But when twilight came, and everything
possible had been done for his patient's
comfort, the doctor, who was tired with his
long ride and the day's strain, went into the
little girl's room and took a much-needed sleep.</p>

<p>"Keep up your courage," he said cheerily
to the biggest brother, as he left him at his post
by the little girl; "her years of outdoor life
will help her rally. I have hope; but wake me
at once if you note any decided change."</p>

<p>The evening hours passed slowly. In the
sick-room the little girl's mother was resting
on the lounge, which had been pulled close to
the canopied bed. The neighbor woman dozed
in the kitchen, beside the table where was
spread the untasted supper. The eldest and
the youngest brothers were stretched, still
dressed, on their beds in the attic. The house
was noiseless, and dark everywhere except in
the sitting-room. There, on the high clock-shelf,
the same tall lamp that, nearly seven and
a half years before, had burned like a beacon
and lighted the coming of the stork, now, turned
low, shone upon the faithful biggest brother
and the suffering little girl.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o'clock an interruption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
came to the silence. A gentle knocking was
heard at the hall door, and, on going out, the
neighbor woman found a cattleman who had
recently moved into the Territory from northern
Texas standing on the stone step. Having
heard that morning from the Swede boy that
the little girl was dangerously ill, he had ridden
down to proffer the services of himself
and his swift horse Sultan. And when the
neighbor woman told him that there was small
hope of the little girl's recovery, he stabled
his animal, and prepared to remain all night.</p>

<p>As he came out of the barn, after having tied
Sultan in a vacant stall, he found that, unknown
to the family, another anxious watcher was lingering
about. A tow head was suddenly thrust
from behind the partly open door, and a hand
halted him by catching appealingly at his
sleeve. "She bane bater?" asked a low, timid
voice.</p>

<p>The cattleman turned, half startled, and
shook his head as he replied, "I reckon she's
a lot worse," he said. He walked on, but
paused again at the smoke-house. The tow-head
was just behind, and the cattleman could
hear the sound of chattering teeth; so he
whipped off his overcoat and tossed it back.
When he entered the hall the chattering had
stopped, and the coat had disappeared into the
shadow of a granary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>After the cattleman settled himself upon the
bench in the kitchen, the house fell into quiet
once more; and it was not until midnight that
the hush was broken. Then the biggest brother,
having moved the curtains of the canopied bed
and turned up the lamp, discovered what he
felt to be the dreaded change in the little girl,
and uttered a frightened exclamation.</p>

<p>Her face, so long flushed with fever, was
blanched and wan. Her eyes were entirely
closed, and their long lashes lay on her cheeks.
Her arms were outspread and relaxed, her
palms open. Her breathing was so faint that
he had to bend his ear to her lips to hear it.
He was certain that the end was near, and hastened
to call his mother and summon his brothers
and the doctor. They were joined in the
sitting-room by the neighbor woman and the
cattleman.</p>

<p>It was apparent to all that a change for the
worse had taken place in the little girl. Yet
the doctor, who hurried to her side, watch in
hand, betrayed neither satisfaction nor alarm
as he bent above her; and the group about him
could only wait in suspense.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sigh from the pillow,
and the little girl opened her eyes. For a week
she had recognized no one. Now she looked
about at the faces turned upon her, and a
faint smile curved her lips. It brought a cry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of joy from her mother. "Oh, pet lamb," she
said, "the doctor's here, and he's going to
make my baby well."</p>

<p>A shade passed over the little girl's face,
and she glanced from her mother to the doctor.
"I'm really not a baby," she said in a weak
voice, but with something of the old spirit; "my
mother jus' says that. I'll be seven in June."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, and smiled back at her.
His fingers were still at her wrist, and his face
wore a worried expression. The cattleman
leaned and whispered a question in his ear, and
he replied out loud. "I can't tell," he said.
"She may and she may not."</p>

<p>The little girl's eyes closed. The doctor
poured out a stimulant, and put the glass to
her mouth. When he lifted her head, she drank
it, and her breath came in longer and heavier
respirations. No one spoke.</p>

<p>All at once a sound of scratching at the front
door, followed by whining, startled her so that
she looked up once more, and her lips moved.
"That's Luffree," she said. Her mother began
to smooth her head tenderly, and it brought
a new thought to the little girl. "'Monia'll
give me curly hair," she added, and closed her
eyes again.</p>

<p>The family watched her hopelessly, for to
them the doctor's silence had only one meaning;
but the cattleman, standing behind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
eldest brother, could not bear the wordless waiting.
He felt that if she would rouse and continue
to speak, death would be delayed. So he
called to her pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Little gal!" he said huskily; "little gal!"
She stirred wearily, and her lids fluttered as if
she were striving to lift them. "Little gal,"
he went on; "I want ye t' fight this out. Don't
ye let no ol' typhoid git <i>you</i>. An' when ye git
well, ye jus' come to see me, an' ye kin hev
anything on th' whole ranch." She turned her
face toward him. "Anything on th' whole
ranch," he repeated, his voice breaking. She
moved one hand till it found one of her mother's,
then she lay very still.</p>

<p>The biggest brother dropped to his knees beside
the bed and crouched there. The youngest
brother began to weep, leaning against the eldest.
The neighbor woman crept away toward
the kitchen, her face buried in her apron. The
cattleman turned his back. The mother clung
prayerfully to the transparent hand. And so
passed a long and despairing five minutes.</p>

<p>But at its end the doctor uttered an ejaculation
of surprise and pleasure, and sprang to his
feet. At the same time he raised a warning finger
and motioned all toward the kitchen.
They obeyed him and retreated, remaining together
in troubled impatience until he came
among them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't be absolutely certain," he said, his
face alight with happiness, "but I believe you
can all go to bed with safety. Things seem to
have turned our way: her skin is soft and
moist, her temperature is down, and, better
than anything else, she's asleep."</p>

<p>As a full realization of the good news broke
upon them, all save the biggest brother sat
down to talk it gratefully over. But he dashed
out of doors to voice his joy, and, as he bounded
up and down the yard, half laughing and half
crying, he caught up a muffled figure that was
lurking in the rear of the kitchen and swung
it high into the air.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the weeks that followed, while the
little girl was slowly fighting her way back to
a sure hold on life, there often came into her
mind, vaguely at first and then more clearly,
the promise that the cattleman had made her
the night they thought she was dying. "Ye kin
hev anything on th' whole ranch," had been his
exact words; and in the intervals when, having
gratified an appetite that was alarming in its
heartiness, she sat in the sun with the dogs
about her, or drove with her mother in the new
buckboard, she pondered them exultantly and
with a confidence that was absolute.</p>

<p>However, it was not until she was so well
that she was again saying pert things to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
eldest brother, and so strong that she was once
more tending the herd, that she determined to
pay the cattleman a visit and remind him of
his agreement. Aware that the family would
oppose her acceptance of a gift from a neighbor,
she made her preparations for the trip in
secret, and quietly left the farm-house one Sunday
afternoon, taking with her a bridle and a
gunny feed-bag half filled with oats.</p>

<p>She had chosen a Sunday for several reasons:
she was always relieved on that day of
the task of herding, the youngest brother taking
her place; her mother invariably spent it in
writing long letters that traveled across land
and sea to far-away England; and the eldest
and biggest brothers puttered it away in the
blacksmith-shop, where there were farm implements
to mend, hoes to sharpen, and picket-ropes
and tugs to splice. Usually it was the
lonesomest day of the week to the little girl;
but this Sunday proved to be an exception.</p>

<p>She was careful not to disturb the household
as she set off, and when she passed the cattle,
which were feeding in the river meadows, she
crept round them as slyly as an Indian, so that
the youngest brother, who was fashioning willow
whistles, should not see her. Once having
gained the straight road that led across the railroad
track toward the cattleman's, she took off
her hat and made faster progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>But the way was long, and, still weak from
her recent sickness, she was easily tired. When
only two thirds of the distance was traveled
it was so late that the night-blooming flowers
were unfolding their chalices, as white and
glimmering as the little girl's Sunday apron,
to let the crape-winged moths drink their sweetness.
Migrant birds were already speeding
above her, to fly till dawn, and they veered from
their course as they saw her hurrying along
beneath them. Wild creatures that had been
sleeping during the day came from their holes
to seek food and timidly watched her hasten
past. And all along, out of the tall, brittle
grass, the busy lightning-bugs sprang up with
their lanterns to help the dim stars light the
way.</p>

<p>It was dusk on the plains before she looked
in, through a tangle of corn and young cottonwoods,
upon the low shanty, in front of which
sat the cattleman in his shirt-sleeves, thoughtfully
chewing a quid. The growl of a dog at
his feet discovered her to him at the same moment,
and, as he squinted in the half-light at
her thin little form and cropped head, she
seemed like some strange prairie fay coming,
light-footed, out of the gloom to meet him.</p>

<p>"Hi thar!" he called, rising up as the little
girl threaded the corn and cottonwoods. She
was breathless with walking, and did not answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as she crossed the yard, shielding herself
with the bridle and the feed-bag from the dog,
bounding boisterously against her. "Wal,
what on airth!" exclaimed the cattleman when
she halted before him.</p>

<p>As she glanced up, he took on the forbidding
height and glowering aspect of her first school-teacher.
But she summoned heart. "How
d' ye do?" she said, nodding at him cordially.</p>

<p>"What're ye doin' up here?" he demanded.
"Ye lost? Come in! come in!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered the little girl, following
him into the shanty.</p>

<p>He lighted a lantern, and, turning it upon
her, eyed her anxiously. She looked even thinner,
paler, and more eerie than she had in the
yard. "Sit down," he said, motioning her to
a bench. But he remained standing, his hands
shoved far into the top of his wide, yellow,
goatskin "chaps," his quid rolling from side
to side. "W'y, I thought you 's a spook," he
laughed, "er a will-o'-th'-wisp&mdash;one. Want a
drink er somethin' to eat? Got lots o' nice
coffee. Guess y' 're petered."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," she declared. And as he
turned from the stove, where he had put the
coffee on to boil, she got up and stepped toward
him. "I&mdash;I&mdash;called to get somefing," she faltered,
resuming, in her trepidation, a babyish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pronunciation long since discarded for one
more dignified.</p>

<p>"Ye did?" queried the cattleman.</p>

<p>"Yes," she continued. "You 'member the
night I 'most died?" He acquiesced silently.
"Well, you told me then that if I'd get well
you'd give me anyfing on your ranch."</p>

<p>The cattleman started as if he had been
stung, and, wheeling about, took out his quid
and threw it on the flames, so that he might be
better able to cope with the matter before him.</p>

<p>"And so," the little girl went on, "I fought
I'd come to-day."</p>

<p>The cattleman rubbed his chin. "I see; I
see," he said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get here sooner," she explained,
"'cause I didn't ride."</p>

<p>"Oh, ye didn't?" he said. Then, noting the
bridle and bag, "What ye got them fer?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to use yours," she replied.</p>

<p>"Mine?" The cattleman was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes: I brought this," she went on, holding
up the bag, "to catch him wiv; and this," holding
up the bridle, "to take him home wiv."</p>

<p>"Him?" questioned the cattleman, more
puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>The little girl saw that she would have to
make herself more clear. "Why, yes," she
said. "You promised me anyfing I wanted if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I'd get well; now I'm well, so I've come to&mdash;to&mdash;get
Sultan."</p>

<p>The cattleman sat down, amazement and
consternation succeeding each other on his face.
Until now he had forgotten the compact made
with her, and which he was in honor bound to
keep. Recalling it, he realized that it meant
the loss of his best horse.</p>

<p>He was silent for a while, thinking hard for
a means of escape from his dilemma. When
he spoke at last he was smiling good-naturedly.
"Ye're right," he said, rubbing his hands
briskly over the long hair of the breeches; "I
did say that very thing. An' I'm a man o' my
word. But it seems to me," and he leaned
forward confidently, "thet ye ain't made exac'ly
the best pick thet ye could." The little
girl sat up with a new interest. "Now I've
got sunthin' here," continued the cattleman,
"thet'll jes make yer eyes pop." He got up,
went to a box that, nailed against the wall above
the stove, served him for a cupboard, and took
out a long, slender package. "Ye've got more
horses than ye can shake a stick at," he began
again; "ponies an' plow teams an' buggy nags,
but ye ain't got nuthin' like what I'm 'bout
to show ye."</p>

<p>Slowly and impressively he began to undo
the package, keeping one eye covertly on the
little girl all the while. She was beside him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
rigid with expectancy. When many thicknesses
of thin brown paper had been unrolled,
he stepped back, unwrapped a last cover, and,
with a proud wave of his hand, revealed to her
delighted gaze a big, thick, red-and-white candy
cane.</p>

<p>"Now, what do ye think o' that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>An exclamation of wonder came from her
parted lips. She moved nearer without answering.</p>

<p>"As I said," he went on, "y' 've got all kinds
of horses; but when in yer life hev ye hed
anything like this?" He laid it gently on the
table, and folded his arms solemnly. "Thet
came all the way from Yankton," he said, as
if recounting the history of some famous work
of art. "I bought it down thar of a feller, an'
paid some little money fer it." He did not
add that she was in his thoughts when he
bought it. "Now I'm going out to hitch up
an' take ye home," he continued. "While I'm
gone, ye make up yer mind which ye want&mdash;" He
started for the door, but paused half-way. "&mdash;which
ye want," he repeated, lowering his
voice, "Sultan&mdash;er thet <i>beautiful</i> cane?"</p>

<p>When he was gone the little girl stole closer
to the table and gazed rapturously down.
Never in her life, as the cattleman truly said,
had she seen anything like it. No horse, on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
prairie overrunning with horses, could compare
with it. She put out her hand and touched
its crooked head, almost reverently, with one
small finger.</p>

<p>The cattleman harnessed a span of fat mules
at the barn, and led them into their places on
each side of a wagon tongue. All the while he
talked out loud to himself, with occasional guffaws
of hearty laughter and sharp commands
to the team. Despite his merriment, however,
he peered back at the shanty uneasily from
time to time; so that it was a full quarter of an
hour before the mules were hitched to the
whiffletrees and ready for their journey. Then
he climbed to the seat and circled toward the
door.</p>

<p>She was not in sight when he brought up with
a loud whoa, and getting down, the lines in one
hand and a black-snake in the other, he advanced
to the sill and looked in. "Any passengers
goin' south?" he cried cheerily, cracking
the whip.</p>

<p>"Me," answered a voice from behind the table,
and the little girl, fagged but blissful, came
forward smilingly, a long, brown-paper package
clasped tightly to her breast.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<h3>"BADGY"</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was the little girl who discovered that
the badgers were encroaching upon the
big wheat-field that stretched westward, across
the prairie, from the farm-house to the sandy
bank of the Vermillion. In bringing the cattle
home from the meadows one night, along the
cow-path that bordered the northern end of
the grain, she allowed several to stray aside
into the field, which was now faintly green
with its new sprouting. And as she headed
them out, riding her pony at full gallop, she
saw a fine shorthorn suddenly pitch forward
with a bellow and fall. She checked her horse
and waited for the animal to rise again. But
it could not&mdash;it had snapped a fore ankle in a
freshly dug badger hole.</div>

<p>The shorthorn was a favorite and, as befitted
her good blood, carried across her dewlap
the string of silver sleigh-bells that in
wintertime tinkled before the pung. So the
news of her injury was received with sorrow at
the farm-house; and when, later in the evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the little girl's big brothers went down to the
field to put the heifer out of her misery, they
vowed that the last feeble jingle of her bells
should be the death-knell of the badgers.</p>

<p>They found that the burrowing host, driven
out of their former homes either by an unlooked-for
seepage or the advent of a stronger
animal, had been attracted to the field because
the harrow had so recently broken and softened
the fallow, and had dug so rapidly since the
planting of a few weeks before, that the north
end, perforated every three or four feet, would
be utterly useless, that year at least, for either
the harvester or the plow. Each family had dug
two tunnels that slanted toward each other and
met at the nest. And since the tunnels of one
family often crossed those of another, the
ground was treacherously unstable. The outlying,
unplowed land also bore, mile upon mile,
marks of the ravages of an army of badgers;
but the north end of the wheat-field was the concentration
camp.</p>

<p>The badgers had thrived in their new home,
for on one side was a grassy rise where the eggs
and young of the plover and prairie-chicken
could be found; and, on the other, a gully led
down to the sloughs that yielded succulent
roots and crawling things. The little girl's big
brothers saw that the animals were so abundant
that shot, traps, or poison would not avail&mdash;only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a thorough drowning-out would rid the
grain-land of the pest.</p>

<p>The attack was planned for the following
day. It would be timely, since four feet beneath
the surface were the newly born, half-blind
litters that could be wiped out by a flood.
Some of the old badgers would, undoubtedly,
escape the deluge and get past the dogs, but
they would be driven away to hunt other
ground for their tunneling.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, when the farm wagon,
creaking under its load of water-barrels and
attended by the dogs, was driven down to the
badger holes in the field, the little girl went
along. Drownings-out were exciting affairs,
for the badgers always gave the pack a fine tussle
before they were despatched; and she was
allowed to attend them if she would promise to
remain on the high seat of the wagon, out of
harm's way.</p>

<p>When the team had been brought to a standstill
on the cow-path, she watched the preparations
for the drowning from her perch.</p>

<p>Two holes were found that slanted toward
each other. One big brother, armed with two
or three buckets of water, stationed himself at
the hole nearer the wagon; and another, similarly
armed, guarded the farther hole. The
pack divided itself, half remaining at each
outlet, and barked itself hoarse with anticipation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>At last all was in readiness, and, at a word,
the water was poured&mdash;bucketful after bucketful&mdash;down
the tunnels. Then a big brother
sprang to the horses' heads to prevent their
running when the fight began, another jumped
into the wagon to refill the pails and hand them
down, and the dogs, leaping excitedly, closed
about the holes. The little girl watched breathlessly
and clung fast to the seat.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no sign of anything.
Suddenly from the nearer hole bounded a
female, the refuse of her nest clinging to her
dripping hair. Whirling and biting furiously
on all sides, she growled in fear and rage as she
defied the pack. There was a quick, fierce fight
that was carried a rod before it ended; then,
amid a din of yelping, the badger met a speedy
death.</p>

<p>The little girl climbed down from the wagon,
and ran to the hole out of which the badger had
come. From her seat she had spied a small,
gray bit of fur in the debris lying about it, and
guessed what it was. She reached the hole none
too soon; for the dogs, having been drawn off
their prey, were coming back, whining and
limping and licking their chops. She caught
up the little, half-drowned thing and climbed
hastily into the wagon again, as the pack, scenting
it, pursued her and leaped against the
wheels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The baby badger came very near to going
the way of superfluous kittens when the little
girl's big brothers saw what she had, and was
saved only through her pleading. She begged
to keep and tame him, and promised to thwart
any desire of his to burrow indiscriminately
about the house and garden. So she was finally
permitted to take him home, snugly wound up
in her apron, and revive him with warm milk.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first time that he saw the world he viewed
it from a subterranean standpoint, his birthplace
being a round, soft, warm pocket far below
the level of the growing wheat. True, his
horizon was somewhat limited, since the pocket
was of small dimensions. Nevertheless, it was
wide to him; and he spent several days in surveying
the top and sides of his home with his
weak, little, blinking eyes before he ventured
to crawl about. Then it was necessary for his
mother to lift him from his cozy bed in the
midst of his brothers and sisters and give him
a sharp pinch on the neck with her teeth to
make him start.</p>

<p>The pocket was reached by a tunnel that had
been well begun and then abandoned by an industrious
but timid pocket-gopher. This timidity
and industry had been taken advantage
of when the badgers began their colonization of
the wheat-field, and the pocket and a second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
tunnel completed; so that the result was a
comfortable residence and, finally, an ideal
nursery. But in all probability he and his
brothers and sisters did not realize how cozily
Providence had placed them until that dreadful
day.</p>

<p>It was when they were having their regular
romp with their mother that the first indication
of trouble came. His father, who had been
sitting at the mouth of the tunnel gossiping
with a neighboring fox, rushed down wildly
to the little family, and fairly fell over them in
an effort to escape by the second tunnel beyond.
The fierce barking of the dogs was heard.
Then the great flood of water swept down upon
them from both tunnels, lifting them all in a
struggling, suffocating mass to the top of the
pocket.</p>

<p>His mother, the instinct of self-preservation
overcoming her parental love, started madly
for a tunnel, and, in swimming against the
floating ruins of her nest, pushed him before
her up the opening and into the full light of
day. There, blinded by the sunlight and exhausted,
he lost consciousness, and lay unnoticed,
partly hidden beneath the feathers and
grass that had made his bed, until the little girl
saw him.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> rewarded her for his first meal by turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on his back with his legs in the air and grunting
contentedly. He was of a grizzled gray color,
soft, fat, clumsy, short of limb and thick of
tail, and displayed, in spite of his few weeks,
a remarkably fine set of claws on his fore feet.
These he alternately thrust out and drew in, as
she petted him, and curled up his long, black-and-white
nose. The little girl thought him the
nicest pet she had ever had, and soon fell a
willing slave to his wheedling grunts.</p>

<p>He was christened "Badgy," and spent the
first month of his new life in a warmly padded
soap-box in the farm-house kitchen. But by
the end of that time he had outgrown the box,
and, the weather being warmer, was given the
empty potato-bin in the cellar. When he was
big enough to run about, he spent his days out
of doors. Early in the morning he was called
from the bin by the little girl, who opened the
cellar doors and watched him come awkwardly
up the steps, ambitiously advancing two at a
time and generally falling back one. After his
breakfast of meat and bread and milk he enjoyed
a frolic, which consisted of a long run in
a circle about the little girl, while he grunted
for joy and lack of breath. When he was completely
worn out with play, he rolled over on
his back and had a sleep in the sun.</p>

<p>Badgy learned to love the little girl; and it
was found, after he had lived in the potato-bin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for a while, that she was the only person he
would follow or meet amicably; all others were
saluted with a snarl and a lifting of the grizzled
hair. So the household came to look upon
him in the light of a worthy supplanter of the
Indian dogs as a protector for her. He accompanied
her everywhere over the prairie, keeping
close to her bare feet and grunting good-naturedly
at every swaying step. If they met
a stranger, he sprang before her, his hair on
end, his teeth showing, his claws working back
and forth angrily. When a Sioux came near,
he went into a perfect fit of rage; and not an
Indian ever dared lay hands upon him.</p>

<p>It was this hatred for redskins that one
night saved the herd from a stampede. Badgy
had been playing about the sitting-room with
the little girl, and trying his sharp claws on
the new rag carpet, when he suddenly began
to rush madly here and there, snapping his
teeth furiously. A big brother grasped the
musket that stood behind the door, thinking
that he had gone mad. But the little girl knew
the signs, and, shielding him, begged them to
go out and look for the Indians she felt certain
were near. Sure enough, beyond the tall cottonwoods
that formed the wind-break to the
north of the house were the figures of a dozen
mounted men, silhouetted against the sky.
They were moving cautiously in the direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the wire cattle-pen; but as a big brother
challenged them with a halloo and followed it
with a musket shot, they wheeled and dashed
away. The last glimpse of their ponies showed
them apparently riderless; which proved to the
little girl's big brothers that the marauders
were from the reservation to the west.</p>

<p>The summer was at its full and the wheat-fields
of the Vermillion River Valley were all
but ready for the harvester before Badgy began
to feel a yearning for his own kind and the
freedom of the open prairie. Then he often
deserted his little mistress when they were
walking about in the afternoon, or sneaked
away after his morning nap in the sun. The
first time he disappeared she mourned disconsolately
for him all day. But late in the afternoon,
as she sat looking across the grain, waiting
for him hopelessly, she forgot her loss in
watching a most curious thing happening in
the wheat. Away out in the broad, quiet field
there was a small, agitated spot, as if a tiny
whirlwind were tossing the heads about. The
commotion was coming nearer and nearer every
moment. Now it was a quarter of a mile away&mdash;now
it was only a few rods&mdash;now it was almost
on the edge. The little girl scrambled to
her feet, half inclined to run, when out of
the tall stalks rolled Badgy, growling at every
step and wagging his tired head from side to
side!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Often, after that, he did not come home until
late at night, when she would hear him snarling
and scratching at the cellar doors, and creep
out to let him in. Her big brothers at last
warned her that there would come a day when
Badgy would go, never to return. So she fitted
a collar to his neck and led him when she went
out, and kept him tied the rest of the time.
This restriction wore upon him and he grew
noticeably thin.</p>

<p>One morning, after having been carefully
locked in the cellar the night before, he did not
respond to the little girl's call from the doors.
She went down to the bin, half fearing to find
him dead. He was not there. She ran about
the cellar looking for him. He was nowhere
to be found. She returned to the bin to search
there again. As she looked in, she caught sight
of a great heap of dirt in one corner. She
jumped over the side and ran to it, divining
at once what it meant. Sure enough, beyond
the heap was a hole, freshly dug, that led upward&mdash;and
out!</p>

<p>The little girl sat back on the heap of dirt
and pathetically viewed the hole. It was not
that he would not come back&mdash;she knew that
he would. But he had made her break her
promise that there was to be no burrowing.
She resolved to say nothing about the hole,
however; and, after closing it completely with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a stone, started off on the prairie in search of
him, his chain in her hand.</p>

<p>When she came back late, she found him in
the bin and gave him a good scolding. He answered
it with angry grunts, and to punish him
she locked him up supperless. But it was
probably no hardship, for he was an adept in
foraging for frogs and water-snakes.</p>

<p>He was in his place next morning, and came
scrambling to the cellar doors when she opened
them. But the following morning he did not
answer her call, and she discovered, on going
into the bin, that there was a second big heap
of dirt near the first. She plugged the hole,
resolving, as before, to keep his misdeeds a
secret.</p>

<p>For six weeks this alternate digging and
plugging went on. Sometimes Badgy burrowed
himself out in one night, sometimes he
would not succeed in reaching the top by the
time the little girl called him. And since he
emerged under cover of the vacant coal-shed
and kitchen that were built against the house
as a lean-to, his depredations were not discovered
by any of the other members of the family.
Once, indeed, he was nearly caught, for
he came out directly in front of the kitchen
door. But judicious trampling by the little
girl soon reduced the soft pile of dirt he had
left at the opening to hard ground again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the little girl's mother found that
a spool of thread dropped on the north side of
the room rolled to the south side. She pointed
out the phenomenon to the little girl's big brothers.
They declared that the south foundation
must be giving way. An investigation
from the outside led them into the shed, where
they found the ground perforated with countless
holes. Then they went into the cellar to
examine further. There the phenomenon was
explained and the culprit brought to light.
Badgy had undermined the house!</p>

<p>The little girl waited in the garden for him
that night, and answered his grunt of friendly
recognition by cuffing him soundly on the ear.
Then, relenting, she took him in her arms and
wept over him. Inside, she knew, they were
plotting to kill him. They had declared that
he should not live another day. And, as she
sobbed, her mind was searching out a plan to
save him. Where <i>could</i> she hide him?</p>

<p>She sat with him held close in her lap for a
while, watching his enemies within. Then she
started on a long detour, with the new haystack
as her destination. He kept close to her heels,
snarling wearily. A few days before she had
made a cave in the stack, which stood between
the barn and the chicken-house. The cave was
on the side nearest the coop, and she decided to
conceal him in it and fasten him there by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
chain. When she had found a stake-pin and a
large stone, she led him in and drove the pin
its full length to make sure that he should not
get away. Then she went back to the house to
secure his pardon from the family council gathered
about the supper table.</p>

<p>She found it a hard task. Her big brothers
urged Badgy's total uselessness as well as his
growing love to burrow, forgetting how bravely
he had always stood between his mistress and
any real or fancied danger. The little girl cried
bitterly as she begged for his life, and vainly
offered the entire contents of her tin bank, now
carefully hoarded for two years, to help repair
the damage he had done. She was finally put
to bed in an uncontrollable fit of grief.</p>

<p>When she was gone, the memory of her tear-stained
face melted her brothers' wrath. They
even laughed heartily over Badgy's disastrous
industry; and at last, relenting, they decided
that he should live, provided he could be kept
out of further mischief. The little girl heard
the good news early in the morning and was
overjoyed. She declared that Badgy should
be good for the rest of his days, and she spent
the afternoon fixing up the new quarters in the
cave.</p>

<p>For the first few nights Badgy was chained
in order to wean him from the old to the new
home, his chain being made so short that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
could not dig far into the ground under the
stack. This wore upon him so that he grew
cross, thinner than ever before, and generally
disheveled. The little girl saw that another
week of such confinement would all but kill him;
while if he were shut up in the cave unchained
he would undermine the stack. She feared,
however, to give him his entire freedom; so
she set to work to puzzle out a scheme that
would solve the problem.</p>

<p>At last she hit upon an idea that seemed
practicable. She would tie up his fore feet so
that he could not dig! Then he could go unchained
in the cave, with only the door of it&mdash;the
top of a big dry-goods box&mdash;to restrict his
movements. Aided by her mother's scissors,
some twine, and a piece of grain sacking, she
put the idea into instant execution.</p>

<p>Badgy did not like the innovation at all. He
squirmed about so when the little girl was tying
up his feet that she made slow progress. And
when she was done, he tried vainly to pull off
his new stockings with his sharp teeth, grunting
his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disapprovel'">disapproval</ins> at every tug. He worked
himself into a perfect fury as he bit and tore,
and finally rolled clumsily to the back of the
cave, where he lay growling angrily.</p>

<p>Pleased with her success, the little girl
left him. But she had failed to reckon with
Badgy's nature, and her plan was doomed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now early autumn,&mdash;the time when
Nature tells the badgers that they must provide
themselves with a winter retreat,&mdash;and Badgy
could no more have kept from burrowing than
he could have resisted eating a frog. So when
the dark came on, he went to work, close to the
door of the cave, burrowing with might and
main, his long nose loosening the dirt for his
fore feet to remove. He worked so fast that
it was only a few minutes before his claws came
though his stockings. Then he redoubled his
efforts, and dug on, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, after having burrowed
down for a time, then along a level, and, finally,
on an upward slant, as instinct directed him
to do, he came through the crust of the earth.
He climbed out of his burrow and sat upon his
haunches at its mouth to rest a moment. As
he did so, he heard a sound above him and
looked up to see what had caused it. Over his
head were several perches on which sat a number
of sleepy fowls. He was in the chicken-house!</p>

<p>He grunted in surprise, and at the sound one
of the chickens uttered a long, low, warning note
that awakened the others. As they moved on
their perches, Badgy eyed them, twisting his
head from side to side. The loose dirt clinging
to his snout and breast fell off with his
heavy breathing, and his stockings hung ragged
and soiled about his front legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was another and a louder
cry of danger from a chicken, following a
slight noise near the door of the coop. Badgy
looked that way to see what was coming, and
through a hole in the sod wall made out the evil
face of a mink, peering in. It came closer, and
there were more cries from the chickens overhead,
for they had recognized the approach of
their mortal enemy. In a moment his long,
shining body had come through the hole, and
he had paused, crouching, to reconnoiter before
making a spring.</p>

<p>Badgy watched him, his nose curling angrily,
his claws working back and forth. Then, as
the mink crept stealthily forward, measuring
the distance to a pullet on a lower perch, the
badger ambled toward him, snarling furiously,
his teeth snapping and his eyes glowing red
with hatred.</p>

<p>The fight was a fierce one, and the cries of
the two animals as they twisted and bit
aroused the whole barn-yard. The chickens set
up a bedlam of noise, flying about from perch
to perch and knocking one another off in their
fright. But Badgy and the mink fought on,
writhing in each other's hold, the mink striving
to get a death-grip on Badgy's throat, while
he tried as hard to rend the mink's body with
his teeth and claws.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of the struggle, the
door of the coop was thrown open and a man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
figure appeared. The animals ceased fighting
instantly, and the mink, letting go his hold, disappeared
down the hole that Badgy had dug.
But Badgy, surprised at the intrusion, only
stared at the newcomer, and grunted a cross
greeting as the light of a lantern was flashed
upon him, sitting there crumpled and bloody.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, when the little girl went out
to the haystack, she could not find Badgy. Instead,
as she pulled aside the door that closed
the entrance to the cave, a strange animal shot
out and away before she could catch a glimpse
of it. This puzzled her; when she went into
the cave she found a great heap of dirt that
troubled her still more. She saw that in spite
of his stockings, Badgy had dug himself out.
She hunted for the hole that she knew would
tell her where he had come through to the surface
again, but she could not find it.</p>

<p>She began to run here and there, calling him.
There was no answering grunt. She thought of
the potato-bin, and flew to the cellar to see if he
had not returned to his old home, but he was
not there.</p>

<p>That night he did not return, nor the next
day, nor the next. No one could tell her where
he had gone. For he had disappeared as completely
as if the earth in which he had loved to
dig had swallowed him up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever she spoke of him in the house
among the family, there was an exchange of
glances between her mother and the eldest
brother. But she never saw it,&mdash;and it was
just as well that she did not.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<h2>XI</h2>

<h3>A TRADE AND A TRICK</h3>


<div class='cap'>A THIN column of blue smoke was ascending
into the quiet April air from a spot far
out upon the prairie. Against the eastern sky,
now faintly glowing with the coming dawn, it
stood forth, uniting the gray heavens and the
duller plains, as straight and clear as a signal-fire.
It gave warning of an Indian camp.</div>

<p>The family at the farm-house, called from
their breakfast by the baying of the dogs, gathered
bareheaded about the kitchen door and
watched the mounting pillar, striving to make
out any crouching figures at its base. But no
hint of the size of the redskin company could
be gained; and, when the biggest brother had
climbed from the lean-to to the ridge-pole of the
roof and his mother had peered from the lesser
height of the attic window, they could not even
catch a glimpse of the top of a tepee, of a skulking
wolf-dog, or of the shaggy coat of a grazing
pony.</p>

<p>After her mother and the three big brothers
had returned to the table, the little girl, whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the barking had called from a bowl of grits and
skimmed milk and a wash-pan of kerosene in
which her chilblained feet were soaking, struggled
to the top of the rain-barrel at the corner
of the house and anxiously eyed the rising
smoke. Fresh in her mind was the murder of
the Englishman at Crow Creek, whose full
granaries and fat coops had long tempted roving
thieves from the west; and the slaying of
the Du Bois family on the James, just a few
miles away. Many a winter's evening, about
the sitting-room stove, and often in the twilight
of summer days, sheltered by her mother's
skirts, she had heard these stories, and that
other, almost within her own memory, terrible
and thrilling to frontier ears,&mdash;the massacre
of the Little Big Horn.</p>

<p>The big brothers always laughed at her
fright and at the idea of any possible danger;
yet they taught her to know an Indian camp-fire,
the trail of an Indian pony, and the print
of moccasined feet, and told her, if she ever
met any braves on the plains, to leave the herd
to take care of itself and ride home on the run.
So, remembering only their warnings and forgetting
their confident boasting and how sure
and awful was the punishment meted out from
the forts to erring wards of the nation, her
days were haunted by prowling savages that
waited behind every hillock, ridge, and stack;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and she cried aloud in her sleep at night when,
on dream-rides, there was ever an ugly, leering
face and a horrid, clutching hand at her
stirrup.</p>

<p>But if the big brothers did not share her fear
of the Indians, yet they guarded well the farm-house
and barn when the Sioux passed in their
pungs in winter or on fleet ponies during the
summer months. And when, that morning, the
fire marked the near-by camp, there was no
scattering to the thawed fields where the plows
stood upright in the furrows. The eldest brother
busied himself in the handy sorghum
patch; the youngest rounded up the cattle and
sheep and drove them south just across the reservation
road to the first bit of unturned
prairie; and the biggest got out the muskets
and loaded them, and leashed the worst-tempered
dogs in the pack.</p>

<p>And so the morning passed. In the sorghum
patch the eldest brother placidly dropped seed.
Across the road the youngest lay on his back
beside his herd pony. And, inside, by a window,
the biggest sat and watched the smoke,
now a wavering spiral in the light breeze that
fanned the prairie; while their mother, knowing
that the best way to receive an Indian is
with corn-cakes and coffee, stood over the
kitchen stove. But the little girl kept her sentinel
place on the rain-barrel until the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
veered her shadow from the side of the house
to the earth bank piled against it. Then she
climbed down and, running to the sod barn,
saddled, bridled, and mounted the swiftest
horse in the stalls and careered back and forth
between house and stable like an alert scout.</p>

<p>When noon came and the cow-horn summoned
the family to the dinner-table, not a sign
of an Indian, beyond the smoke, had been seen.
So, by the end of the meal, it was decided that
a visit should be paid the camp to see how many
braves composed it, and why they did not move
on. The biggest brother volunteered to make
the ride, and, when he started off, the little
girl, whose horse had been fretfully gnawing
the clapboarding at the corner of the kitchen,
also mounted and followed on behind, riding
warily.</p>

<p>They skirted the corner of the freshly turned
potato-field and wheeled into the reservation
road behind the herd. But scarcely had they
gotten half-way to the stony rise that bordered
the eastern end of the potatoes, when they saw,
coming over its brow and also mounted, an
Indian. He was riding fast toward them, and
they reined and stood still till he cantered up.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said the biggest brother, noting the
fine army saddle and the leather bridle with
its national monogram in brass as the redskin
brought his horse to its haunches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hullo," answered the Indian. His eyes
had an anxious look in them as he glanced from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"What you want?" The biggest brother
nodded toward the smoke.</p>

<p>The Indian waited a moment, hitching his
blanket impatiently as he tried to find an English
word with which to reply. Then, failing,
he suddenly slipped from his horse to the
ground, threw himself flat upon his face, and
began, with much writhing, to breathe heavily,
as if in great pain.</p>

<p>"Somebody's sick," said the biggest brother,
and, without waiting, he clapped his heels
against his horse's sides and set off toward the
camp. The little girl came after, cantering just
in advance of the redskin, whom she watched
stealthily from the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>A mile out to the east the trio halted for a
moment on a low ridge and looked down a gentle
slope upon the camp. It was pitched where
the reservation road crossed a ravine, and at
its center, beside a rivulet, was a fire of buffalo-chips
from which the smoke steadily arose.
About the fire, and before two tepees, sat a half-dozen
braves, five in government blankets, with
their black mops bound back, the sixth in flannel
shirt, leather breeches tucked into high boots,
and a broad felt hat over his long hair. South
of the fire, in the ravine, several horses, closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hobbled, were cropping the new grass; and between
them and the tepees, lying half under a
light road wagon, was an animal stretched flat
and covered with blankets.</p>

<p>"It's that horse," said the biggest brother.
The Indian behind him grunted and rode ahead
down the slope, and, at his approach, the circle
about the camp-fire stood up.</p>

<p>As the face of the Indian wearing the wide
hat was turned toward them, the little girl gave
a joyful cry and whipped her horse with her
rope reins. The army saddle and the monogrammed
bridle were no longer a mystery, the
camp was no longer to be feared,&mdash;for the unblanketed
brave was the troop's scout from the
reservation, the half-breed, Eagle Eye!</p>

<p>The next moment he was explaining how, returning
from Sioux Falls, where for a fortnight
he had been winning admiration for his
military appearance, his feats on horseback, and
his skill with the rifle, he had fallen in with the
party of Indians, which was coming back from
a trip beyond the Mississippi. After a long,
hard ride together the day before, they had
been forced to go into camp in the ravine because
the blue-roan mare which one of them was
driving had suddenly lain down and refused to
rise. And she had remained stretched out
since, and was breathing deep and painfully.</p>

<p>When the biggest brother rode over to where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
she lay, he saw at once that she was sorely
stricken with pneumonia, and that only prompt
attention would be of any use. Her great
brown eyes were wide and starting with agony,
her delicate nostrils were distended and dry,
and her iron-gray sides were heaving.</p>

<p>"You've got to get her out o' here, Eagle
Eye," said the biggest brother, as he and the
little girl leaned over the panting animal;
"she'll go in no time on this wet ground. Suppose
we make a <i>travee</i> and haul her home."</p>

<p>The Indians received the offer, which Eagle
Eye interpreted for them, with many signs of
pleasure; and in a moment had taken down the
cottonwood lodge-poles cut the previous day,
and brought straps and ropes. But it was mid-afternoon
before the rude litter was finished.
Two poles were fastened to the hind axle of the
wagon, the width of the wheels apart; across
them other poles were roped after having been
chopped into short lengths; and on top of these
were laid some buffalo robes, blankets, and
straw. Then the mare, too sick to resent handling,
was half lifted and half rolled into place.
When the journey to the farm-house was made,
the tough Indian pony between the shafts was
helped in the hauling by a plow team from the
barn.</p>

<p>The <i>travee</i> was untied from the wagon at the
stable, and the three big brothers helped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Indians to drag it into a roomy stall, the little
girl looking on all the while sympathetically.
Then her mother, the biggest brother, and
Eagle Eye poulticed the throbbing chest, put
compresses on the silky neck, and poured one
hot drink after another down the reluctant
throat of the blue mare.</p>

<p>They worked until midnight. But when the
next day broke, chill and drizzily, the horse
seemed worse instead of better, and the Indians,
who had slept with their guns on their arms at
the heads of their saddled ponies, prepared to
go. They seemed so anxious to set off that
the big brothers were suspicious that they had
stolen the animal and were expecting pursuit.
The fact that she had no saddle-marks on her
mottled back, and that they had cumbered themselves
with a wagon, bore out the belief. The
eldest brother spoke his mind to Eagle Eye, but
the half-breed only said that Black Cloud, who
claimed to own her, wished to sell her to the
brothers.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," sneered the eldest
brother; "she'll be ready for the pigs by noon.
I wouldn't take her as a gift,&mdash;and you can tell
'em so."</p>

<p>Eagle Eye turned to Black Cloud and repeated
the answer. It was met with the look
that had named him, and a mumbled threat that
was lost on the white men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl had been standing by and had
heard the conversation. She suddenly started
for the house, and, when she came flying back
a moment later, she had her tin savings-bank
grasped tightly in one fist. Stopping in front
of the scout, she held it out to him.</p>

<p>"Eagle Eye," she panted, "tell Black Cloud
I'll give him all this for the sick horse&mdash;two
whole dollars."</p>

<p>Again the half-breed turned to the glowering
Indian. But this time the evil, dusky face
lighted, and, after consulting with the other Indians,
he took the bank from Eagle Eye and
turned out and counted its contents.</p>

<p>"He thanks the white papoose," said Eagle
Eye, returning the empty bank to the little girl,
"and the pony is yours."</p>

<p>Happy over her trade, the little girl rushed
away to the sick horse, while the eldest brother,
enraged at her interference yet not daring
to stop the bargain, mentally promised to give
her a lesson later.</p>

<p>"If the mare lives," he said aside to the
biggest brother, "you bet these thieves'll even
things up."</p>

<p>The evening of things came sooner than he
expected. For at sundown, after the Indians
had departed, the swift horse ridden to their
camp by the little girl was nowhere to be found!</p>

<p>But, angry as the farm-house felt over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
theft, the big brothers knew that it would be
worse than foolhardy to try to recapture their
animal. And the trade seemed likely to be fair
in the end, after all,&mdash;for at midnight the
family saw that the blue mare was getting
well!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Shrieks</span> of laughter from behind the barn,
following strange, rapid thumps upon the bare
ground, led the three big brothers in that direction
one May morning, and, on turning the
corner, they found the little girl leaning convulsively
against the old straw stack for support,
while in front of her, blinded by a big,
red handkerchief, and with a long bolster full
of hay across her dappled withers, was the blue
mare, making stiff, wild plunges into the air,
with arched back and head held low. For the
little girl was breaking her to ride!</p>

<p>It was the little girl who broke the horses
on the farm to ride. She played with them as
colts, and, with her light weight, mounted them
long before they were old enough to carry any
one heavier, and yet were too old to be sway-backed.
She tried them first as they stood tied
in their stalls, crawling carefully upon them
from the manger. Later, she rode them at a
walk up and down the reservation road.</p>

<p>She had learned the First Reader of the saddle
on the St. Bernard's wide, slipping back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
The pinto had been the Second, and she had
then passed rapidly to the graduation class of
frisky calves and lean, darting shoats. Now,
for two years, all the horses sold at the
reservation by the big brothers had been of her
training, and the troopers vowed that no gentler,
better mounts had ever been in the service.
Her mother viewed the colt-breaking
tremblingly, and the big brothers declared that
the little girl would be buried some day with a
broken neck. But the little girl said nothing,
and continued her riding fearlessly, knowing
that love, even with horses, makes all things
easy,&mdash;except the breaking of the blue mare.</p>

<p>Thirteen hands stood the blue mare, sound,
clean-limbed, and beautiful, and the markings
of her sharp front teeth showed that she was
but four. From velvet muzzle to sweeping tail,
from mottled croup to fetlocks, she shone in the
sunlight like corn-silk. Her mane was black
and waved to her wide chest, and her heavy
forelock hid an inwardly curving nose that
proved an Arab strain. And when, after many
spirited bouts with the hay bolster, the little
girl finally won her over to a soft blanket and
a stirruped girth, she showed the endurance
and strength of a mustang, the speed of a racer,
and the gait of a rocking-chair.</p>

<p>She was so tall that she could not be climbed
upon, like a pony, from the upper side of sloping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ground or from the stone pile on the carnelian
bluff, and too skittish to allow a bare
foot to be thrust behind her sleek elbows as a
step to her back, so the little girl invented a new
method of mounting. Her nose was coaxed to
the ground by the offer of a choice wisp of
grass, and, as her neck was lowered, the little
girl carefully put one leg over her glossy crest
and gave her a slap to start her,&mdash;when the blue
mare raised her head and the little girl hedged
along to her back, facing rearward. Then she
slowly turned about!</p>

<p>Herding on the blue mare's back became a
pleasure, not a despised duty, and long jaunts
to the station, ten miles away, for mail or groceries,
were welcomed. The eldest brother,
too, had ceased to scold the little girl for the
trade with Black Cloud or for the loss of the
horse that was stolen. For the blue mare was
worth two of the other.</p>

<p>The subject hardly ever came up in the farm-house
any more; when it did, it only served to
remind the little girl of a dread prophecy of
the Swede, that, in good time, the swarthy
brave would pass that way again!</p>

<p>The little girl always grew white at the bare
thought. And often the dream of the leering
face and the clutching hand would follow her
by day. If she entered the barn, cruel eyes
watched her from out dim corners; if she rode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
through the corn-field, now waist high, the
leaves rustled a mysterious warning to her.
"Run&mdash;run!" they whispered, and the little
girl obeyed and sought the safety of the open
prairie.</p>

<p>But there were hours of proud security,
when, with the Swede boy as an audience, or,
better still, with the colonel's son, she put the
blue mare through her wonderful trick. This
trick had been discovered accidentally by the
little girl. One morning, when she was breaking
the horse, she put one hand back playfully
and pinched her on the croup to see if she would
buck,&mdash;and, instead, she promptly lay down!
Afterward, the same pinch brought her again
to the ground, and the little girl found that it
needed barely a touch to make the mare perform.
But however delighted she was over her
discovery, the little girl never mounted the
prostrate horse, for she was afraid that she
might roll upon her.</p>

<p>The days had passed, and it was now haying-time.
But the mowers stood idle beneath their
sheds, and the work-horses grazed contentedly
with their heads to the south, for a rain was
passing over the prairie. Inside the farm-house,
the little girl, standing against the
blurred panes, rebelled against the showers,
and fretted for the blue mare and a gallop; the
biggest brother, buried deep in a book, thanked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Providence; while the eldest, remembering the
uncovered cocks in the timothy meadow, cursed
the storm.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the third day of the downpour,
however, the clouds lifted. A new moon
appeared, holding its chin up,&mdash;a promise of
sunshine,&mdash;and the little girl ran happily to the
barn, slipped a lariat into the blue mare's
mouth, secured it with a thong under the jaw,
and, bareback, started toward the sloughs beyond
the reservation road to bring home the
herd. When she was a mile away, the eldest
brother followed her, for he wanted to see if
the grass around the farthest slough would
make good cutting. He rode the bald-faced
pony, and across his pommel was slung his
musket.</p>

<p>The little girl did not see him. Content with
the blue mare beneath her, her mind busy, she
rode on. And her voice, shrill, and broken by
her cantering, floated back to the eldest brother
in snatches:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Scotland's burning! Scotland's burning!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">More water! More water!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then she disappeared over the ridge on her
descent to the herd.</div>

<p>The eldest brother urged his horse a little to
try to catch up with her. But she was going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
faster now, too, and when he reached the top
of the ridge she was in the tall grass between
him and the cattle, and he could just see her
bobbing sailor hat and the flying tail of the blue
mare.</p>

<p>Her song ceased as she neared the herd, for
twilight was coming down and the meadow
blades had taken up the same soft warnings
that she had heard in the corn. Above her,
homing birds called to each other, and bullfrogs
croaked from the sloughs at her horse's
feet. There flashed into her mind the night-and-day
horror of the Indian's face and hand,
and she began to whistle a little to rally heart
as she rode beyond the cows to turn a stray.</p>

<p>But suddenly the sound died on her lips.
For up from the earth rose the ugly, leering
face, and out of the grass came the horrid,
clutching hand! With a choking cry, the little
girl struck her horse, but the next instant was
flung down from her seat, and Black Cloud,
rifle in hand, swung himself to her place.</p>

<p>He dared not fire for fear of sounding an
alarm, and he dared not wait an instant to club
with his gun-stock the little girl, lying stunned
and half-dead with fear. Without a backward
look, he drove the blue mare out of the meadow
to the prairie and turned her toward the river.</p>

<p>But the eldest brother was scarcely a half-mile
behind him. And, as the strange form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
came into view, going like the wind through
the gathering gloom, he guessed what had happened.
He whipped the bald-face wildly, following
the blue mare. And a race for the Vermillion
began!</p>

<p>But it was an uneven one. In a few leaps
the mare had lengthened the distance between
her and the bald-face. Discouraged, and anxious
to know what had become of the little girl,
the eldest brother resolved to stop. But as he
did so, he raised his musket and sent a load of
buckshot after the fleeting brave.</p>

<p>The Indian, safe from pursuit, answered it
with a derisive whoop, and, turning his body
around, still going swiftly, waved his rifle triumphantly
aloft in his right hand and, looking
back, leaned for an instant with the other
on the blue mare's croup!</p>

<p>The horse obeyed the sign like a flash. As
if the eldest brother's shot had found her heart,
she stopped dead still and threw herself upon
the ground,&mdash;and Black Cloud, his face for
once almost white, lunged forward, struck his
head with crushing force against a boulder
on the river's edge, and lay as motionless as the
rock itself!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> that night, when the prairie lay still
and sweet, and the new moon was swimming
westward from cloud-island to cloud-island,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the gray buffalo-wolves came up the Vermillion
on their way to the sheep-pen of the Swede,
and waked the drowsing valley with their howling.
But the trembling ewes and their babies
were not molested; for when the pack reached
the river bank near the farthest slough, they
halted to quarrel at a boulder&mdash;till the sun came
up in the east again and glittered on a string of
glass wampum lying beside the rock.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<h2>XII</h2>

<h3>THE PROFESSOR'S "FIND"</h3>


<div class='cap'>A NIMBUS of mystery clung to the professor
the first two days of his stay. His
arrival, late one afternoon, in the sewing-machine
man's buggy, was as unexplained as
it was unexpected; and when he was shown to
the little girl's room, which she hospitably relinquished,
he volunteered neither his name nor
his place of residence. The following morning
he left the house, carrying a small paper box
and a black hand-bag, and crossed the fields to
the prairie, where he ran about, his spare figure
stooped, as if he were picking something, while
his left hand held an instrument that flashed in
the sun. On his return at noon, his box and
bag were closed, and only a green stain on his
fingers gave any suggestion of what he had
been doing. He spent the remainder of the day
quietly in his room.</div>

<p>The big brothers made various conjectures
about him. The eldest declared that he was
searching for minerals; the biggest thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
him a government agent on a secret mission;
while the youngest, to the terror of the little
girl, who had not recovered from her adventure
of a month before with Black Cloud,
hinted at a dark purpose and openly asserted
that it was dangerous to have the professor in
the house. But, since their mother would not
permit any questioning, their curiosity was not
satisfied nor their fears allayed until the professor,
unasked, revealed his identity.</p>

<p>Then it was ridiculously simple. He was a
professor in the botanical department of an
Eastern university, and had come West to obtain
floral specimens. The paper box held his
fresh finds; the bag, a telescope with which to
distinguish plants not easily accessible, and a
microscope to study those close at hand. In
his trunk were heavy blank books filled with
dried leaves, pressed blossoms, and scientific
notes.</p>

<p>When the little girl heard that he taught in
one of those colleges, remote and wonderful,
of which she dreamed, her suspicions were
straightway transformed into reverence. She
listened eagerly to his every word, watched
him, agape with interest, as he wrote at the
sitting-room table, and hung at his heels, happy
and fascinated, when he walked up and down,
smoking a cigar, under the ash trees in the
twilight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the big brothers respected
him less than ever. To them flower-hunting,
as an occupation, seemed trivial and effeminate.
Flowers, though they were well enough
in their proper places,&mdash;the front garden or the
grass,&mdash;were usually a nuisance that crept
through the crops and choked their growth,
until descended upon and tediously jerked up,
one after another, by the roots. And a man
who could give his entire time not only to the
collection of nosegays but to the gathering of
<i>weeds</i>, could not have the esteem of the big brothers.
All three, whenever they spoke of him,
raised their shoulders contemptuously, after
the manner of "Frenchy."</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before their attitude
changed. The professor was so gentle
and courteous, yet so firm and convincing, and
so full of knowledge concerning things about
them of which they were entirely ignorant, that
they soon came to view him seriously. The
eldest and the youngest brothers even took
turns at driving him on long trips in the buckboard,
and the biggest loaned him a pair of
rubber boots so that he could hunt in swamps
and wet meadows for bristly buttercups and
crowfoot.</p>

<p>After she found out that he was a professor,
the little girl always accompanied him
on his jaunts. Before that, the herd being in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the care of the Swede boy, she spent the days
either in skilfully outlining on a wide board,
by means of a carpenter's pencil and an overturned
milk-pan, cart-wheels for the box of
the little red wagon, or in playing "Pilgrim's
Progress," seated on an empty grain-sack
which Bruno, snarling with delight, dragged
by his teeth along the reservation road from
the Slough of Despond to the gates of the Celestial
City. She also helped her mother prepare
for the coming Fourth of July celebration
at the station.</p>

<p>But she gave up everything to go with the
professor while he scoured the prairie to the
north, east, and south, and burdened herself
willingly with the lunch-bucket and his umbrella.
From dawn till noon, for a whole fortnight,
she trotted beside him, straining her eyes
to catch sight of some plant he had not yet seen,
and tearing here and there to pluck posies for
his bouquet. When, however, there remained
to be searched only a wide strip bordering the
Vermillion, she remained at home.</p>

<p>The professor carried forward his work
along the river enthusiastically, planning to
finish by the eve of the celebration, so that he
could accompany the family to the station on
the morning of the Fourth, and there take the
afternoon local going east. He tramped up
and down the bluffs, finding many a rare shrub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in high, sunny spots or low, sheltered nooks,
and returning to the farm-house only when he
was laden with spoil. But it was on his very
last excursion that he discovered something
really remarkable.</p>

<p>He visited a point far up the valley, where
the banks were precipitous and came close together.
At their base lay narrow reaches of
sand between which, even at its lowest, the
river hurried; and when it was swelled by
heavy rains or melting snow, it rushed through
boisterously and spat high to right and left
against the walls.</p>

<p>The western side, with its southern exposure,
was the greener. Box-elders belted its foot,
growing at a sharp angle to the side. Above
the elders an aspen thrust out its slender trunk,
and, still higher, grass and weeds protruded.
Where the cliff was of solid rock, trailing wild-bean
drooped across and softened it. But the
professor, after sweeping it carefully with his
glass and finding no new specimens upon it, resolved
not to waste his time and labor, and
turned his attention opposite.</p>

<p>Though almost bare, for it faced the north,
the eastern precipice still was promising. No
trees interrupted its rise, and the stones that,
midway, coincided with it were uncovered.
Low down were scattered clumps of wild black
currant and clusters of coral-berry. But above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the stones, bending temptingly forward into
plain view, was a cactus which the professor
had long sought.</p>

<p>He determined to scale the wall and secure
the plant. Dropping the paper box and the
hand-bag, he toiled from the sand to a first narrow
ledge, from there to the currant bushes,
and thence higher, by relying for a foothold
upon snake holes and crevices. Once having
gained the flat stones, the climb was over. He
had only to put out his hand and gather the
cactus.</p>

<p>But its stalk remained unbroken. For his
eye, traveling over the rock to which he was
clinging, made out a figure and some letters
cut deep into its red-gray surface. He looked
at them with interest, then with mingled pleasure
and doubt, and lastly with wonder. And
he trembled as, with one hand, he finally drew
a small blank-book from an inner coat pocket
and began to copy. He realized at once that,
though it did not relate to floral science, he had
ended by making a most notable find.</p>

<p>Having finished, and put away his pencil and
book, he studied the figure and letters carefully
for a few moments, and then descended
slowly to the sand. All thoughts of growing
things had faded from his mind; in their stead
came crowding others that pictured possible
fame. He sat down to rest and think beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the box and the hand-bag, and stayed there,
bowed over, his spectacles in his hands, his eyes
roving thoughtfully, until the sun was so low
that the little ca&ntilde;on was in gloom.</p>

<p>At suppertime he announced his discovery
to the big brothers and their mother. They
received the news with amazement. The week
previous he had declared that the plains were
once covered by a vast ocean, and had proved
his assertion by showing them sea-shells at the
top of the carnelian bluff. So they expressed
their intention of visiting the cliffs, never
doubting his second and almost incredible
statement that, long before the Indians came
to inhabit the surrounding country, it had been
the home of a superior race of Latin origin.</p>

<p>The little girl was at the table and heard the
professor's story; and she showed some agitation
as she listened with downcast eyes. She
knew more about the red-gray rock and its
scribblings than she cared to tell before the big
brothers, for she had spent one whole happy
afternoon in the ca&ntilde;on with the colonel's son,
watching him as he scrambled up the south
bank, with the agility and sure-footedness of
a goat, and hung for an hour in mid-air by one
hand. So, while she ate her bread and smear-case,
she made up her mind to follow the professor
after the meal was over and unburden
herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>But no chance to see him alone was afforded
her. He disappeared to pack his trunk while
she was doing the dishes, and did not emerge
again during the evening. She squatted under
his window for a while in the dark, hoping that
he would look out, and gave up her watch
only when she heard him snoring. Then she,
too, went to bed, where she lay turning and
twisting until after midnight. Dropping off,
at last, she dreamed that she and the colonel's
son had been court-martialed by the professor
and were to be shot at the celebration.</p>

<p>Breakfast was eaten at three o'clock next
morning, and at sun-up the light wagon and
the buckboard were ready for the drive to the
station. Every one had been so busy since rising
that the professor's discovery was not
mentioned. In fact, the big brothers and their
mother had forgotten it; the little girl thought
of it many times, however, and hoped each moment
that she could speak privately to the professor.
And he, as he took his seat in the buckboard,
remembered it and smiled contentedly,
never suspecting that the youngest brother,
riding beside him, had secretly planned to file
at once a claim on the quarter-section that included
the little ca&ntilde;on so that the red-gray rock
should be lawfully his.</p>

<p>Arrived at the station, all became occupied
with the celebration. While the big brothers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
took care of the horses, their mother and the
little girl changed their dresses at the hotel.
The professor hunted up the grand marshal,
held a whispered conversation with him, and
was assigned a place in the procession. For
the scientist purposed that the day should be
more than one of national commemoration to
the townspeople: it should be one of local rejoicing.</p>

<p>This was the first public holiday ever observed
at the station, for it was still very
young. Two years before, when the railroad
crept up to it and passed it, it consisted of a
lonely box-car standing in the center of a
broad, level tract flecked with anemones. The
next week, thanks to a sudden boom, the box-car
gave place to a board depot, with other
pine structures springing up all about, and to
long lines of white stakes that marked the avenues,
streets, and alleys of a future city. Now
it consisted of half a hundred houses and stores
surrounded by as many shanties and dugouts.</p>

<p>The streets were gay with color. Everywhere
festoons of red, white, and blue swung
in the morning breeze, and flags flapped from
improvised poles. Horses with ribbons braided
into their manes and tails dashed about, carrying
riders who were importantly arranging for
the procession, and who wore broad sashes of
tricolored bunting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowds added further to the brightness
of the scene. Soldiers in uniform, frontiersmen
in red shirts and leather breeches, farmers
and men of the town, dressed in their best,
and Indians in every imaginable style of raiment,
filled the saloons and shooting galleries,
where they kept the glasses clinking and the
bells a-jangle. Women and children, in light
dresses and flower-trimmed hats, lined the
scanty sidewalks and the store porches, with
a fringe of squaws and Indian babies seated in
the weeds beside the way or on the steps at
their feet.</p>

<p>But at ten o'clock both men and women
came into the open, for the procession had
formed across the track in the rear of the depot
and was advancing. Excitement was high.
Crackers were popping on all sides, horses
were prancing wildly, frightened by the unusual
clatter, and people were laughing and
shouting to one another as they craned to
catch a first glimpse of the oncoming cort&egrave;ge.</p>

<p>A silence fell suddenly as the grand marshal
rounded the depot, leading the way north to
the grove where the exercises were to be held.
Behind and flanking him rode his aides, and
in their rear walked the band, a few in a prescribed
dress of red caps, blue coats, and white
trousers, others lacking in one or more details
of it, but jauntily wearing substitutes in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
shape of straw hats and store clothes. About
them trailed a gang of small boys, an inevitable
though uninvited part of every procession,
and, after, rumbled heavy floats representing
events in the history of America,&mdash;General and
Mrs. Washington at Mount Vernon, Pocahontas
rescuing Captain John Smith, Lincoln freeing
the Slaves, and Columbus greeting the Redmen.
Following was a company of cavalry
from the reservation, with the colonel and his
son at their head, and a band of Indians, naked
but for their breech-cloths, and in war-plumes
and paint, that whooped and brandished their
bows and arrows as they bolted from side to
side.</p>

<p>But the crowning feature of the parade came
next. It was a hay-rack wound over every inch
of its wide, open frame with the national colors,
drawn by four white horses, and bearing the
Goddess of Liberty, Columbia, Dakota, and a
score of girls who represented the States and
Territories, and who wore filmy white frocks,
red garlands on their hair, blue girdles about
their waists, and ribbons lettered in gilt across
their breasts.</p>

<p>To the family, as to many, the passing of the
rack was a proud moment, for the little girl
rode upon it. Like her companions, she was
hatless, and she shone out from among them
as she stood directly behind the goddess, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
her hair, a two years' growth&mdash;she was
now nine and a half years old&mdash;rippled luxuriantly
about her face.</p>

<p>Her place in the rack had been assigned her
as a special honor. It was found, when the
girls assembled to receive their garlands and
colors, that there were not enough of them to
represent fully the map of the United States.
So the little girl, being the last to arrive, was
given three ribbons bearing the names of California,
Texas, and Minnesota.</p>

<p>As the hay-wagon rolled by the family, the
compliment paid the little girl did not escape
their eyes. The cattleman, too, observed it,
and proudly expressed himself to the biggest
brother. "Say!" he whispered, "don't she
cover a lot o' terrytory!"</p>

<p>The little girl was aware of the attention she
was attracting, and she kept a graceful poise,
looking neither to one side nor the other. Each
girl on the rack held something in her hands
that suggested the wealth of the particular
State she symbolized. So the little girl wore,
just under her collar, the picture of a fat beef
as an appropriate emblem of Texas, while in
one hand she carried a gilded stone to recall
California's riches, and, in the other, through
the instigation of the grand marshal, who had
once been jailed at St. Paul, she held aloft a
wad of cotton batting to emphasize the annual
snowfall of the rival State to the east.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The end of the procession consisted of decorated
buggies&mdash;in which sat the orator of the
day, a local poet, the school-teacher at the station,
the minister, the professor, and a dozen
prominent citizens&mdash;and a rabble of horribles
and plug-uglies that rent the air with yells;
as it went by, it bore the admiring crowd in its
train. When the grand stand was reached, the
people quickly filled the board benches which
had been put up for them, while the principals
in the festivities settled themselves picturesquely
upon the platform.</p>

<p>It was after twelve o'clock, so the program
opened at once. The professor, sitting well
in the foreground, fidgeted inwardly and hoped
that the train on which he was to depart would
not arrive before he had had his opportunity.
But he sat smiling, nevertheless, throughout
the opening prayer by the minister, the address
of the day and the reading of the Declaration
of Independence by the orator, the verses of
the poet, the teacher's song, and four band
pieces. On his lap were two large squares of
white pasteboard which he fingered nervously,
and every two or three minutes he took note of
the time.</p>

<p>When his turn came at last, it was with calm
dignity, as becomes a scholar, that he rose and
stepped forward to the edge of the stand, where
the orator, in ringing tones, introduced him as
"our distinguished guest." Then, amid a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hush, partly of curiosity, the professor began
his speech.</p>

<p>Up to this time the little girl had been but a
mildly interested onlooker. She was seated,
with the other States, just behind the row of
prominent citizens, listening less to the exercises
than to the buzz about her, and refraining
from talking only when the band rendered
a number. The colonel's son was down in
front and facing her, so she divided her time,
when she was silent, between him and her mother.
In the excitement of the hour she had
totally forgotten the professor.</p>

<p>But now, with him at the speaker's table, she
suddenly recalled the evening before, her sleepless
night, and her worry. And she quaked as
she leaned forward to hear what he was saying,
and bent her looks in fear upon the colonel's
son.</p>

<p>The professor, having bowed to all sides
and cleared his throat, launched into the subject
of his discovery, prefacing it with a reference
to the carnelian bluff.</p>

<p>"It shows by the deposit on its summit," he
said, "that at one time, centuries ago, a boundless
sea, that roared when the winds swept by
or lapped and slept in a calm, covered the
bosom of this prairie. Beneath the arrowheads
and hatchets that mark it as a natural
watch-tower of the redmen, lies, deep-hidden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a layer of sea-shells, proof that this plain was
once an ocean bed."</p>

<p>He paused a moment at this point to allow
the full significance of his words to impress
itself upon the assemblage before him. Then
he continued.</p>

<p>"But I have discovered the proof of a far
greater marvel concerning this prairie-land of
yours. A sea tumbled over it, as I have said;
yes, but, more wonderful still, in ages past&mdash;I
cannot say how many&mdash;a race, intellectually
superior to the Indian, dwelt here. As borne
out by the inerasable markings I have discovered,
this race was undoubtedly a branch or
part of a people that we have hitherto believed
never visited the continent until Columbus's
time."</p>

<p>The teacher, the poet, and the minister
opened their eyes with interest as his statement
fell upon their ears. But no thrill of surprise
swept the crowd, and the professor, after a
pause, coughed and went on.</p>

<p>"I intend to submit my discovery to the scientific
world. As proof of it I have two drawings
which I shall show you. They consist of
copies of inscriptions found by me on the Vermillion.
This is one of them."</p>

<p>He displayed the larger pasteboard square
and a titter ran through the crowd. To her
alarm, the little girl noticed that the colonel's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
son did not laugh. Instead, he opened his
mouth and stared wildly. Another instant and
the square was turned toward her. She gave
a cry when she saw the figure drawn upon it.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>"Notice," said the professor, "how large
and C&aelig;sarean is the head. It is the crude outline
of a man whose arms are outstretched as
if in appeal to or in adoration of some god.
The attitude is full of dignity and strength. It
is unquestionably an ancient graffito."</p>

<p>He turned to the table and lifted the second
square. "I have been working for years in
scientific fields," he began once more, "accepting
what small honors came my way, grateful
that I have been able to name two new species
of flowers. Now, I have chanced upon something
in the boundless stretches of the plains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that promises reward as well as fame. Heretofore,
no scientific men, strictly speaking, have
searched the prairies for arch&aelig;ological traces.
Hunters, travelers, soldiers, priests, and statesmen
have gone across, their eyes bent on different
phases of the country. And so it was
for me, an humble student, to uncover the undreamed-of."</p>

<p>He turned once more to those behind him,
holding up the second pasteboard. The little
girl shrank in her seat as the three accusing
letters, written large upon it, fell beneath her
apprehensive gaze:</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>The professor looked hurriedly at his watch,
seized his hat and the drawings, and made a
parting bow. "I leave on the coming train,"
he said regretfully; "I see that it is now almost
due. I promise you that I shall return in
the near future. Until then, farewell."</p>

<p>The crowd parted respectfully to let him
pass as he hastened down the steps of the
grand stand and away. The little girl looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
after him undecidedly. Then, a quartet having
moved between her and the colonel's son,
she cast aside the gilded rock and the cotton
batting and threaded the assemblage on the
run.</p>

<p>The two had the short, dusty road to themselves,
and they traveled it rapidly. The professor,
with a rod's start, kept well ahead of
the little girl, and came into the depot on time,
his hat in his hand. She, breathless, arrived
a moment later, just as the engine slowed down.</p>

<p>The professor had heard no one behind him,
for all noise had been drowned by his own
rush. So, without looking back, he sprang toward
the last coach and swung himself on by
the rail of the farther steps, his drawings under
one arm, his hands encumbered with the box
and bag which he had picked up in the waiting-room.
Suddenly a voice caused him to turn.</p>

<p>"Professor!" cried the little girl. She was
puffing so hard that she could not continue.</p>

<p>"Bless my heart!" said the professor, descending
to the lowest step and catching her
by the hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, professor!" she cried again.</p>

<p>"Yes? Yes?" he said inquiringly. The
train was starting and there was no time to be
lost. She ran beside it for a few steps.</p>

<p>"I did that!" The little girl pointed at the
pasteboard under his arm. She fell back. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
cars were moving rapidly now, and she was too
tired to pursue them.</p>

<p>"You!" gasped the professor, clapping one
hand to the drawings; <i>"you!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;not me, but a boy," she added
chokingly.</p>

<p>The professor put his hands to his head, and
the squares, escaping his arm, were blown from
the steps and fluttered upon the graveled embankment.
The little girl saw them fall and
ran forward to secure them. He did not see
her. He was sitting on the top step of the fast-receding
train, his face covered as if to shut
out a fearful sight, his coat-sleeves pressing
his ears as if to deaden a shout of ridicule.</p>

<p>The little girl looked after him, holding the
pasteboards in her hands. "I'm sorry," she
said out loud, "that nobody made these a long
time ago. But they couldn't, 'cause they're
my 'nitials."</p>

<p>Then she walked back toward the grand
stand, where the band, with small boys encircling
it, was rendering the final number of the
program,&mdash;a resounding "America."</p>

<h3>A RACE AND A RESCUE</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT'RE you doin' under there?"
asked the biggest brother, looking beneath
the canopied bed, where the little girl was
lying on her back, her feet braced at right angles
to the loose board slats above her.</div>

<p>There was no answer, but the broad counterpane
of bright calico squares that, by its
heaving, had betrayed her presence, became
suddenly still.</p>

<p>"Because," continued the biggest brother,
"I'm goin' to the station this afternoon with
the blue mare and the buckboard. And if you
ain't doin' nothing and want to go along, just
slide out and meet me on the corn road."</p>

<p>He exchanged his gingham jumper for a coat
at the elk antlers in the entry, and left the
house. When his whistle was swallowed up by
the barn, the little girl crept stealthily from her
hiding-place, washed her feet, changed her
apron, and, under cover of the kitchen, hurried
eastward to the oat-field. Having gained it,
she turned north, crouching low as she ran.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Haytime</span> was over and harvest was close at
hand. In the brief space between, the reapers
were being put into shape for the cutting of
the grain. That morning, while the biggest
and the youngest brothers were repairing the
broken rakes of a dropper, the eldest had
sharpened the long saw-knife, aided by the little
girl, whom he compelled to turn the squeaking
grindstone. They had begun early, working
under the tool-shed, and for hours the little
girl had labored wearily at the winch-handle,
with only an occasional rest. By eleven o'clock
her arms were so tired that she could scarcely
go on, and she became rebellious. Perhaps it
was not only her fatigue, but the fact that
"David Copperfield" had arrived the day before
and was awaiting her temptingly in the
sitting-room, that caused her, in a cross though
not malicious moment, to give the circling handle
such a whirl that the reaper blade was
jerked violently forward; and, as it bounded
and sang against the stone, it cut a gash in the
eldest brother's hand.</p>

<p>The swallows nesting under the roof of the
shed saw the little girl suddenly run toward
the house, followed by the irate eldest brother,
who carried a basin of water. The two disappeared
into the entry, the little girl leading.
When the eldest brother came out, still holding
the basin, he looked angry and warm. For,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with all his hunting, she had managed to escape
him, and he was obliged to nurse his wrath and
his hand unavenged.</p>

<p>The little girl had dived under the canopied
bed, where she stayed, holding her breath,
while the eldest brother looked for her high
and low. When he went out, calling the youngest
brother to take her place, she yet remained
discreetly hidden. At dinner-time a plate of
food and a glass of milk mysteriously made
their appearance at the edge of the bed, so that
she was able to stay in seclusion and wait for
the storm to pass. But even "David Copperfield,"
which arrived with her meal, did not aid
her in whiling away the hours. So the biggest
brother's suggestion came as a welcome relief.</p>

<p>When the buckboard rolled along the corn
road, the little girl stepped out of the field and
climbed to the seat on the driver's side. Neither
she nor the biggest brother spoke, but, as
the blue mare jogged on, she took the reins
from him and chirruped gaily to the horse,
with an inward wish that, instead of being in
the buckboard, she were free of it and on the
blue mare's back. The mare made poor progress
when she was hitched between shafts, since
she was not a trotter, and reached her best gait
under a blanket. But this was known to the
little girl alone, for the big brothers never
went faster than a canter, and would have punished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
her if they had guessed how rapidly, on
each trip to the station, the horse was ridden.</p>

<p>The little girl usually started for town in the
early afternoon, as the biggest brother had that
day. In this way the local passed her, going
east, when the trip was half over. As the engine
came in sight, the little girl urged the
mare to a slow gallop, and, as the cow-catcher
got abreast, gave her a sharp cut that sent her
forward beside the train. And so swift was the
high-strung horse that she was never left behind
until a long stretch of road had been covered.
The little girl liked best, however, to
start the race at the outer edge of the broad
meadow that lay west of the station, because,
by acquiring speed before the engine came on
a line with her, she could ride up to the depot
with the rear car.</p>

<p>The almost daily brush with the train was
seemingly as much enjoyed by the blue mare
as by her rider. With the engine's roar in her
ears and its smoke in her nostrils, she sped on,
neck and neck with the iron horse. When the
local was still far behind she would begin to
curvet and take the bit between her teeth.
After the first few contests, she needed no
whip. The little girl had only to slacken the
reins and let her go, and she would scamper
into the station, covered with dust and foam
from her flashing eyes to her flying feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>While the little girl was thinking over her
exciting rides, the biggest brother was mournfully
looking around at the farm. The year
had been a disastrous one. A chinook had
swept the prairies in the late winter, thawing
all the drifts except those in sheltered gullies,
and giving a false message to the sleeping
ground; so that, long before their time, the
grass and flowers had sprung up, only to be
cut down by a heavy frost that was succeeded
by snow. Again a hot wind had come, and
again the grass had sprouted prematurely and
been blighted. When spring opened, the winds
veered to the south and drove back, and what
green things had survived the cold died early
in a hot, blowy May.</p>

<p>Lack of moisture had stunted the growing
crops, the sun had baked the ground under
them, and every stem and blade had been
scorched. Where, in former years, the oats
had nodded heavy-headed stood a straight,
scanty growth. The wheat showed naked spots
on its western side, the Vermillion having overflowed
after the sowing and lain so long that
the seed rotted in the wet. The flax stems
turned up their blue faces and shriveled into
a thin cover on the sod. And in the corn-field,
that promised nubbins instead of the
usual husking, there shone too soon a glimmer
of gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Around the fields the brittle grass sloped
down to the shrinking sloughs, where the muskrat
houses stood high and dry, stranded on the
cracked swamp-beds like beached boats. The
river, for weeks a wide-spread, muddy stream,
was now but a chain of trickling pools.
Drought was abroad with its burning hand,
and the landscape lay bared and brown.</p>

<p>But frost, sun, and winds had not been the
only scourges. Potato-bugs had settled upon
the long patch that was bordered by the reservation
road. The youngest brother had
painted the riddled vines green with poison,
and the little girl had gone along the rows with
a stick, knocking thousands of the pests into an
oyster-can; but their labor had been in vain.
Cutworms had destroyed the melons; cabbage-lice
and squash-bugs had besieged the garden,
attended by caterpillars; and grasshoppers
by the millions had hopped across the farm,
devouring as they went and leaving disaster
behind them.</p>

<p>The hot wind that bent the stunted grass beside
the road reminded the biggest brother of
every catastrophe of the year, and he cried out
angrily to it. "Oh, blow! blow! blow!" he
scolded, and, reaching over, gave the blue mare
a slap with the reins to relieve his feelings. It
started her into a smart trot, and she soon
topped the ridge along which the track ran.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Then the little girl headed her toward the
station.</p>

<p>"It only needs a fire to finish the whole thing
up," went on the biggest brother, ruefully eying
the prairie. "The country's as dry as
tinder. And our place ain't plowed around
half well enough. If a blaze should happen to
come down on us"&mdash;he shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his words, there came
from behind them a gust of hot air that carried
with it the smell of burning grass. He faced to
the rear with an exclamation of alarm and,
shading his face, peered back along the rails.
"Catch that?" he asked excitedly. "There <i>is</i>
a fire somewheres; it's behind us. And the
wind's in the west!"</p>

<p>The little girl sprang to her feet, the buckboard
still going, and also looked behind.
"Why, I can see smoke," she said. She
pointed to where a dark haze, like shattered
thunder-clouds, was rising from the sky-line.</p>

<p>"It's been set by that confounded engine,"
declared the biggest brother. He seized the
reins and brought the blue mare to a stop.</p>

<p>The little girl stood upon the seat, holding
his hand to steady herself. "Don't you think
we'd better drive home?" she questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," he replied. "Seems
to me like the smoke's gettin' thicker awful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fast. We don't notice it much because the
sun's so bright. But it ain't more 'n eight
or ten miles away, and comin' like sixty. It
could make the farm ahead of us. We'll just
get on to the back-fire at the station and keep
from gettin' singed."</p>

<p>They sat silent for a moment. Then the biggest
brother turned about and clucked to the
blue mare. But the little girl continued to
squint against the sun until, in descending into
a draw, the black haze behind was lost to view.</p>

<p>The biggest brother kept the blue mare at a
good gait, and the road, with its narrow strip
of weedy grass down the center, flew by under
the bouncing buckboard. Soon the long, gradual
incline leading up from the ravine was
climbed. At its top, on a high bench, the
horse halted for breath. Both the biggest brother
and the little girl at once rose to their
feet. As they did so, they uttered a cry.</p>

<p>A moving wall of animals, that stretched far
to north and south, was heading swiftly toward
them from beyond the river bluffs. They could
hear the sound of thousands of hoofs, like the
ceaseless roll of dulled drums, and across the
black level of the wall they saw a bank of
smoke, into which leaped tongues of flame.</p>

<p>Without losing a second, the biggest brother
began to urge on the blue mare. The black-snake
was missing from its place in the buckboard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
So he used the ends of the reins. He
saw that the wind, which had been brisk all
day, was now redoubled in strength, increased
by another that found its source in the advancing
fire. He wondered if he had not better unhitch
and let the horse carry them both, abandoning
the buckboard to its fate on the road.
Yet he feared to lose any time, and, reflecting
that perhaps the spirited creature would refuse
to ride double, he decided to hurry on without
making the change. As the mare responded to
the rein ends, something like a prayer moved
his dry, firm-set lips. For he knew that they
were menaced not only by a conflagration, but
by a mad stampede.</p>

<p>"The local'll be along in about half an
hour," said the little girl, speaking for the first
time since their dread discovery. "Do you
think the fire'll hurt it?"</p>

<p>The biggest brother laughed uneasily.
"No," he replied, "it'll go right through the
fire; but the cattle'll pitch it off the track if
they get in front of it."</p>

<p>The little girl faced around to watch the oncoming
rout, and the biggest brother renewed
his thrashing of the blue mare. But he was
not satisfied with the horse's speed. She was
acting strangely, wavering from side to side as
if she were anxious to turn, at the same time
keeping her head high and whinnying nervously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p><i>"You</i> know what's comin'," the biggest
brother said to her between his teeth; "and
you'd go back if I'd let you."</p>

<p>The little girl called his attention from the
mare with a shout. He turned to look in the
direction of her shaking finger. What he saw
blanched his dripping face. From a point on
the prairie where he knew the farm-house
stood were ascending several dense, black
funnels!</p>

<p>The line of flying animals had now crossed
the farm. The blaze seemed to be at the very
flanks of the herd, licking up the dry weeds and
grass from under their speeding feet. The biggest
brother groaned as his eye swept the oncoming
panic. He forgot for a moment the
danger to those at home and the terrible loss
that, doubtless, had been visited upon them,
in the thought of the impending fate of himself
and the little girl. "They'll be plump on us
in no time," he muttered, and, kneeling at the
dashboard, he renewed his beating.</p>

<p>A bare three miles ahead lay the meadow
beyond which was the town and safety. The
thundering host behind, at the rate it was coming,
would catch them while they were crossing
the wide basin, where the dropseed-grass and
blue-joint were higher than the wild hay on
the prairie about. There the herd would have
to increase its running to escape the swifter-going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
fire; hence, there lay the greatest peril
to the biggest brother and the little girl.</p>

<p>In a few moments the animals heading the
rout were out of sight in the draw crossed a
little while before by the buckboard. The fire
followed them, creeping slowly down the farther
hillside, where the growth was poor; but
when it, as well as the stock, disappeared in the
bottom, where the grass stood thick and tall,
the narrow ravine top vomited smoke and flame
like the mouth of a crater.</p>

<p>In a terribly short space the stampede rushed
up the bench and came on, a dense mass, horning
and shouldering wildly. It was soon so
close that the horses could be distinguished
from the cattle. Then it gained on the buckboard
to such an extent that the little girl could
make out, through the smoke and dust that
whirled before it, animals that she knew. But
they were changed. Was that old Kate, the
cultivator mare, with bulging eyes and lolling
tongue? Or young Liney, the favorite daughter
of a well-loved mother, whose horns cut the
grass as she fled? Or Napoleon's dusky son,
Dan, near the rails? Even above the sound of
their feet and the roar of the fire, she could
hear them bawling from weariness and fear as
they charged ruthlessly on toward the buckboard.</p>

<p>The blue mare was failing in her stride and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
acting more obstinately than ever. Now to the
right, now to the left, she turned, and it was
with difficulty that the biggest brother kept her
in the road. She answered every blow on her
lathered hindquarters with an angry hump.
The biggest brother, as he pounded her mercilessly,
felt that escape was impossible.</p>

<p>Beside him, quiet and brave, sat the little
girl. A spot of scarlet showed on either cheek,
her eyes were alight, her figure tense. If she
felt any terror, she did not show it. She knew
how rapidly the blue mare could travel, and
she trusted her pet to bring them to safety.</p>

<p>As the buckboard struck the meadow road,
the biggest brother gave a hurried glance over
his shoulder to see how far behind was the
herd. "Never saw so many animals all together
in my life," he said. "They'll kill us
sure if they catch us. And that fire's drivin'
'em at an awful clip. My God!"</p>

<p>The cry burst from him in dismay as a huge,
burning tumbleweed, as high as a wagon-wheel
and as round, rolled through a gap in the stampede
and whirled past them, lighting the grass
as it sped. A second and a third followed.
Soon a dozen brands had shot forward, heralding
the crackling fiend behind. The blue mare
shied wildly when the weeds came close, and
each time the buckboard almost capsized. She
was lagging more than ever, as if waiting for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the animals that were scarcely a half mile
away.</p>

<p>There was fire all around now, and smoke
and cinders floated over the biggest brother
and the little girl, choking them and shutting
out the road ahead. The wind, as it brushed
by, seemed to sear their faces with its torrid
breath. Suddenly, the dust and smoke clearing
to the right, the little girl clutched the biggest
brother's arm and pointed out a dark, bulky
creature that was in the lead. It was a bison,
evidently one of those lonely bachelors that,
exiled from their kind, were the first hermits
of the plains. His bushy head was lowered
and his beard swept the ground. The biggest
brother and the little girl could see his naked
body gleam and quiver as he was crowded forward
by a band of antelope. He galloped
blindly, as if he was failing in strength. Even
as they looked he tumbled to his knees and let
the antelope pass over him, meeting an ignoble
death beneath a hundred sharp hoofs and in
the embrace of the fire.</p>

<p>The biggest brother's attention was given to
the bison only an instant. For a long-horned
steer collided with a hind wheel and a horse
came dashing against the blue mare. He
guided the buckboard nearer the rails to avoid
the horse and reached round to hammer with
his hat the steer's nose, which was thrust almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
against the seat. "They'll trample us,
they'll trample us!" he cried, and he seized the
little girl about the shoulders and thrust her in
front of him. "Drive," he commanded. Then he
climbed back over the seat and furiously kicked
out at the animals lunging upon the buckboard.</p>

<p>But he could as easily have stopped the pursuing
fire, which was in the meadow and was
house high; for, with those in the rear pressing
them on at every bound, the leaders could not
slacken their course. He saw that there was
but one thing to be done: increase the speed before
the buckboard was run down. "Oh, why
didn't I unhitch?" he cried miserably as he
climbed back to the little girl's side.</p>

<p>Forgetful of danger, she was whipping the
blue mare with all her strength. The mare was
traveling as fast as the herd now, and the station
was in sight despite the drifting dust and
smoke. Before it lay the black stretch at which
the fire must stop, and on which, if the blue
mare could be brought to a standstill behind a
building or a waiting car, there was succor
from death. Yet hope&mdash;with the herd upon
them and the fire closer, hotter, and deadlier&mdash;was
almost gone. The biggest brother, in a
very final frenzy of desperation, joined his efforts
to those of the little girl, and pounded
the blue mare and the crowding stock repeatedly
with his naked fists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly another phase entered into
that run for life. The roar behind them became
louder, swelled to deafening, surged to
their ears like a long, deep boom of thunder.
And then, with a shriek that seemed to divide
the smoke and dust, the local plunged through
the cloud across her track and came even with
the blue mare's muzzle.</p>

<p>In that moment, worn with her five miles'
gallop, it was the only thing that could have
spurred her on. Her eyes were bulging from
lack of breath. Her sides, streaked with blood,
no longer responded to the scourge of the rein
ends. But, with the engine abreast, the desire
to worst it, long nurtured by the little girl, set
her into a wilder pace. With a snort, she gathered
herself together.</p>

<p>The buckboard, tossing from side to side on
the uneven meadow, gained instantly on the
herd and passed to the front once more. The
engine had distanced it, yet the blue mare did
not slacken. The biggest brother and the little
girl, torn between hope and fear, yelled
at her encouragingly. Breathing heavily, she
strained every muscle to obey.</p>

<p>Another moment and the engine was on the
burnt strip; another, and the last car reached
it; a third, and the blue mare's feet struck it,
and she scurried into the lee of the depot to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
let the animals behind her divide and charge
by through the town.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> biggest brother, as soon as the blue mare
had been tenderly cared for, hired a livery
horse and started homeward. The little girl
accompanied him, her face, like his, still
streaked with dust and cinders. Neither spoke
as the bare, smutty meadow was crossed. They
only looked ahead to where smoke was rising
slowly, ten miles away to the west. They were
spent with excitement, but their thoughts were
on their mother and brothers, the house surrounded
by a straw-strewn yard, the line of
stacks behind the barn, the board granaries,
the fields dry and ready for the match.</p>

<p>As they drove rapidly along through the
sunlight, over the land just scored and torn up
by the stampede, they passed dead and injured
animals that, weaker than the others, had fallen
and been trampled and burned. Few horses
and cattle had suffered, but, beginning at the
draw, the sheep were pitifully plentiful.
Everywhere smoke floated up in tiny threads
from smoldering buffalo-chips, and clumps of
weeds burned damply, only now and then
bursting into flame.</p>

<p>At last, with a shout of joy, the biggest brother
made out the farm-house; with an unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
cry he announced the burning of the
stacks. And when the buckboard came still
nearer, they could see that the granaries were
gone, and that all the sod buildings were roofless
and open to the blurred sky, while on
every side&mdash;the corn-field alone breaking the
vista&mdash;lay the blackened fields.</p>

<p>When they drove up, their mother tottered
to meet them, and waved one hand heartbrokenly
toward the kitchen door, where the
eldest and the youngest brothers, exhausted
with fighting fire, their faces grimy, their
clothing burned to tatters, sat weeping.
"It couldn't have been much worse," she
sobbed, as the biggest brother took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>The little girl tumbled from the buckboard
and, forgetting their quarrel of the morning,
threw her arms around the eldest brother's
neck. He bowed his head against her apron,
and there was a long silence, interrupted only
by sounds of mourning. Then the biggest brother
spoke. "Mother," he said, patting her
shoulder softly, "we've got the house and the
farm left, remember. We've got one another,
too." He paused a moment. Before he spoke
again he gave a little laugh, and all looked up
at him in surprise. "What's more," he went
on, "where's the caterpillars and cucumber-bugs,
and the potato-bugs and cabbage lice?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Burned up, slicker 'n a whistle. And mother,"
he persisted, holding up her tear-stained
face smilingly, "have you happened to consider
that there ain't a blamed grasshopper in
a hundred miles?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>HARD TIMES</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE first deep snow of the winter, dropping
gently from a wide, dun sky, rested
in white folds on the new straw roofs of the sod
buildings, crested the low stacks that had been
hauled from distant meadows not swept by the
fire, covered the cinder-strewn gaps in the yard
where the granaries had stood, and hid under
a shining, jeweled pall the stripped fields and
the somber prairie. The little girl's mother,
stringing pop-corn in the kitchen for the Christmas
tree at the school-house, looked out toward
noon to see the farm restored, as if by enchantment,
to the aspect of other and happier
winters; and sorrowfully welcomed the winding-sheet
that gave promise of the coming resurrection,
when the grass and flowers should
rise again from out the naked, charred ground,
bright and glorious with the fresh-born spring.</div>

<p>It had seemed to her, ever since the terrible
holocaust of a few months before, as if the Bad
Lands had moved eastward upon them. Yet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
however sad was the sight of their loss and
the sense of their privation, she counseled
against selling out at a small figure and moving
to some State where prairie fires were unknown,
and bravely determined to stay and
fight back to rough comfort and plenty.</p>

<p>"The snow will help us to forget," she said
to the biggest brother, as she took a hot,
crammed popper from him and emptied it into
a milk-pan. He nodded in reply, and sprinkled
the popper with kernels again, and she went
back to her bench, carrying the pan under one
arm. They sat without speaking, the click of
the needle and the snapping of the corn alone
breaking the quiet. When another popper was
ready to be turned out, the biggest brother
went into the adjoining shed with a wooden
bucket and shoveled it full of coal from the
ever-lessening pile that had been purchased,
like the seed for the coming planting, on the
promise of the next year's crop.</p>

<p>As he returned, bending under the weight of
the bucket, the door into the entry was shoved
slowly open and the little girl entered. She
walked forward to lay her mittens on the table
before she brushed the snow from her shoulders
and leggings and untwisted and shook out
her nubia. Her woolen cap was pulled far
down over her ears, and her mother, as she
watched her, did not see the grave eyes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
pensive face until the little girl halted beside
the biggest brother's chair to warm her hands
at a stove-hole.</p>

<p>"How's the tree?" asked the biggest brother,
putting down the bucket and depositing
one small lump on the dying coals.</p>

<p>"It's setting in a churn," replied the little
girl, without looking up.</p>

<p>"Is it trimmed?" said her mother.</p>

<p>The little girl acquiesced. "It's all ready
to light."</p>

<p>"S'pose those Dutchman's young ones
brought some things over to put on," ventured
the biggest brother, shaking the popper violently
to hide his concern.</p>

<p>The little girl sighed heavily. "Everybody's
sent presents but the Swedes and us,"
she said, and there was a telltale break in her
voice.</p>

<p>"The Swedes and us won't have much on,"
declared the biggest brother, dryly. "That fire
scooped up our Christmas gifts. The only people
around here that can make presents this
year were smart enough to backfire." He
gave the popper such a shake that the lid
swung up and let a shower of kernels fall over
the stove.</p>

<p>"The Dutch girls said this morning," began
the little girl, "that their new house is better 'n
ours. And they said that every one of 'em is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
going to have two presents off the tree to-night.
And&mdash;and&mdash;I know it's true, too, because
I saw the teacher write their names
on the packages." She paused a moment.
"They're all big packages," she added mournfully.</p>

<p>"I am glad," said her mother, "that some
one is to receive presents to-night, even if we
do not."</p>

<p>"And where <i>you're</i> goin' to shine," broke
in the biggest brother, giving the little girl a
squeeze, "is in the program. You'll play that
new tune you learned on the fiddle, and you'll
speak your piece; and they'll all be as jealous
as kingdom come. As for presents, well,
you've been gettin' 'em straight for ten years;
so you c'n afford to skip the eleventh." He
got up to empty the popper in the pan.</p>

<p>The little girl did not reply at once. When
she burst forth at last, her eyes were full and
her breast was heaving. "It's our first school
tree," she cried; "and here I'll be the only
girl that won't have her name called, except
for an old orange or a bag of candy." Then
she hurriedly left the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Poor baby!" said her mother when she was
gone. She disposed of the stringing of the
pop-corn to the biggest brother and began to
pick over a quart of wheat that was to be their
supper. Having finished and put it on to boil,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
she turned to the roasting of some barley for
the next morning's coffee.</p>

<p>"I wish we'd a-got her a little trinket for
to-night," said the biggest brother, "even if
it'd a-been only worth ten cents." He took
out his pipe and filled it from a handful of
corn-silk in his jumper pocket. "<i>I'd</i> be tickled
to death," he added, "if I could have a plug
of tobacco."</p>

<p>"And I a sack of flour," said his mother.
"We'll have the last in biscuits for to-day's
dinner. I suppose I shouldn't have used it up
for a week more, because we had white biscuits
only last Sunday. But it is Christmas day; I
can't resist giving you boys something a little
extra. I've kept enough flour out, though, to
thicken gravies with. Now, if we only had
plenty of potatoes."</p>

<p>"When it gets nearer spring, we c'n eat the
inside of the potatoes and save the peelin's for
plantin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought of that long ago," laughed
his mother; "I've got half a sack of peelings
here behind the stove where they won't
freeze."</p>

<p>"The meat's gettin' low, ma. There's only
a hunk or two left in the barrel, and I just noticed,
when I was gettin' the coal, that that pig
in there on the rafters is dwindlin' fast. I
guess another cow'll have to go. Might as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
well, anyway. Hay won't more 'n last the
horses."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the eldest and the
youngest brothers, who came in, stamping the
snow from their boots and swinging their arms.</p>

<p>"Gee! it's cold!" cried the youngest, keeping
in a far corner, out of way of the warmth from
the stove, and thumping his toes alternately as
he moved in a circle. "Sloughs are frozen to
the bottom. Didn't catch a thing, and had to
use the ax to chop out the traps every place
we'd set."</p>

<p>Dinner was eaten in silence that Christmas
day. The family could not help contrasting
the meal with those served on former like occasions.
Since nearly all the turkeys and
chickens had perished in the fire, and what few
remained were being kept over for the following
year, no plump fowl lay, shins in air, before
the eldest brother. A small piece of baked
pork held the place of honor, surrounded by
the never-absent dish of boiled wheat, the plate
of precious white biscuits, and some sweetened
corn-bread. When dinner was over, the big
brothers tramped off to the chain of sloughs,
taking with them the violin and the corn their
mother had strung so that the latter could be
put on the tree that afternoon. The little girl
and her mother cleared the table and then sat
down to unravel some old wristlets and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
them knit new heels and toes into the big brothers'
stockings.</p>

<p>The little girl was very quiet and thoughtful.
Her mouth drooped mournfully, her eyes were
wistful. She spoke to her mother only in answer,
and then in monosyllables. Her mother,
as she watched her, felt that the little girl's unhappiness
was the last bitter touch to her own
grief, and she was glad when the child put on
her dried leggings, her cap and coat, preparatory
to spending an hour in her own room,
where there was no fire.</p>

<p>The mother heard no sound from the other
part of the house until the middle of the short
afternoon. Then she caught the notes of a
song. A moment later the little girl came running
into the kitchen, her eyes dancing, and
went running out again, carrying a sheet of
brown wrapping-paper and a long piece of
white string. No more sounds came from her
room. When she came out at suppertime,
dressed for the evening's entertainment, she
was her usual cheerful self, much to the mystification
of her compassionate mother and the
big brothers.</p>

<p>There was a false ring of gladness in the
sleigh-bells that night as they came jingling
from the stable. For what right have sleigh-bells
to ring when every pocket is flat and when
there is no lumpy flour-sack hidden from sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
under the hay in the pung bottom? So the eldest
and the youngest brothers, their mother and
the little girl, took their places in the low box
and let the biggest brother cover them with a
feather-tick, without any of the gay laughter
and banter that marked the pleasure-rides of
former years. Then the biggest brother, only
his eyes showing from his head-wrappings,
sprang to his seat behind the horses and sent
the team briskly forward with the storm toward
the huge bonfire of cottonwood logs that
had been lighted close to the school-house on
the farther edge of the farthest slough.</p>

<p>When the reservation road, hidden under
four feet of packed snow, was crossed, the pung
slid down to the carpeted ice of the first slough
in the train of the capering horses, and was
whisked through the crisp night toward the
distant beacon. So swiftly did it scud that, before
the quartet behind realized it, the horses
had pressed up the hill beside the burning cottonwoods
and halted before the school-house.</p>

<p>The little girl was the first to scramble from
the snug box when the tick was lifted. Still
wearing a big buffalo coat that enveloped her
from head to foot, she squirmed through the
door, about which was a crowd, and threaded
her way past the high desk that daily secluded
her while she ate her poor lunches, past the hot
stove with its circle of new-comers, to where,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
hidden by the chart, stood the teacher. There
she held a moment's whispered conversation,
produced a package from under her greatcoat,
and then joined the other children, who were
seated up in front on boards placed across the
main aisle.</p>

<p>The little building, that had been saved in
the prairie fire by the well-trodden oval around
it, was crowded with the people of the district,
assembled to enjoy their first public entertainment
and tree. Among the younger ones
were the Dutchman's girls and their baby
nephew, the neighbor woman's children.
"Frenchy's" brother, and the Swede boy. On
either hand and behind were the grown people,&mdash;the
Dutchman and his wife, the young
couple from the West Fork, the cattleman,
"Frenchy," the Swede, and the big brothers
and their mother. When the family entered,
the room was so full that the eldest and the
youngest brothers had to content themselves
with a perch on the coal-bins. The little girl,
turning to survey the room, could not catch a
glimpse of the biggest brother, however, and
finally concluded that he was still busy with
blanketing the horses and putting them away
in the long shed.</p>

<p>The tree was ablaze from its top to the rim
of the cloth-wound churn, and was hung with
tinsel trimmings from the farm-house,&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
selfsame trimmings that for years had twinkled
and winked at the little girl each Christmas
eve. Among the tinsel was festooned the pop-corn,
while from every bending branch and
stem hung apples and oranges supplied by the
teacher, colored bags of candy and bright
cornucopias given by the cattleman, sorghum
taffies-on-a-stick made by the neighbor woman,
while eggs, colored in gaudy and grotesque patterns
by boiling them in pieces of calico, were
suspended in tiny cunning willow baskets that
testified to the nimble fingers of the Dutchman's
wife. Around the base of the churn and
heaped high against it was the pile of gifts.</p>

<p>The program opened immediately after the
arrival of the family. The teacher, keeping
one eye upon the fast burning and unstable
candles above her, came forward to the edge
of the platform to say a few words of greeting.
The children then gave a rousing Yule chorus,
the laden boughs over them waving gently in
time with their voices. The little girl and her
violin followed, and the tree was as still as
those who sat before it while the strains of "I
Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls" floated tremblingly
out from under her uncertain bow. A
new settler's four-year-old lisped "Six Little
Rabbits," with many promptings and encouraging
nods from the teacher. The Dutchman's
youngest got up to recite "The Burial of Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
John Moore," and, though shaking from head
to foot, attacked the doleful stanzas in a
high key and with sprightly gesticulations.
"Frenchy's" brother spoke in his own tongue
a piece that was suitable to the occasion; much
to his amazement, it elicited peals of laughter.
When he sat down, the program wound on its
tedious, recitative way until the tree was again
supplied with candles by the neighbor woman's
son, and the little girl arose to deliver a welcome
to that same Santa Claus from whom she
expected nothing.</p>

<p>If her mother, the big brothers, and the
doting Swede boy hoped to see her final effort
a triumphant one, they were disappointed, for
she spoke falteringly and, at one juncture, forgot
her lines. Her eyes wavered from her mother
to the tree, from the tree to the teacher,
and her closing words were inarticulate.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the moment, however,
only the fond few noticed her confusion. The
faint tinkle of bells and the swelling toots of a
tin horn were announcing the approach of
Santa Claus. Before the little girl had finished,
and in spite of the teacher's admonition,
the children were standing up and looking expectantly
toward the rear; and no sooner had
the little girl taken her seat, than they broke
forth into excited chatter, calling to one another
eagerly. Then the door was suddenly thrust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
open to the sound of a shrill toot, and Santa
Claus came bounding in.</p>

<p>Amid the din of the horn and the shouts of
the children, he clambered forward to the platform,
bobbing to right and left, and tweaking
the ears of those he passed. Long, yellow rope
hair hung down from under a round, scarlet
cap, and a rope beard reached to his portly
waist. Cotton snow and another kind that
melted promptly in the warm room covered his
shoulders and sleeves. In a gruff though
merry voice that sounded above all the others,
he sang out the names pinned to an armful of
candy-bags.</p>

<p>One by one, big and little hurried up to receive
their gifts of sweets. The little girl
evinced none of the delight that shone on the
faces of the other children. She watched the
distribution silently, with no glad throbs of the
heart, and took her share of the fruit and candy
with downcast eyes. Her mother sorrowfully
noted that, even when the bags and cornucopias
had been given out and Santa turned
his attention to the pile around the churn, her
interest did not increase.</p>

<p>She watched dully as the girls skipped boldly
up, with proud, knowing looks, to seize their
presents, or the boys sidled forward bashfully
with changing color. All unwrapped and admired
their gifts as soon as they were back in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
their seats. The Dutchman's girls shrieked
with joy as they undid their presents, the
neighbor woman's daughter could scarcely
hold her share in her best apron. "Frenchy's"
brother had distended pockets. The young
farmer's baby crowed in purple delight over
the stack of parcels before him.</p>

<p>The little girl's lap was empty, save for the
candy and fruit dropped carelessly into it.
When the pile around the churn had dwindled
sorely and but a dozen gifts remained, the little
girl had not yet gone forward to claim one.
The other children had been too occupied to
notice her ill fortune until they had spent their
first joy over their gifts. Then one of the
Dutchman's girls elbowed the neighbor woman's
son, who sat next her, to call his attention
to the little girl, and he passed the news
on. Soon all the children were glancing questioningly
at her and nudging one another.</p>

<p>The neighbor woman's daughter, who had
often shared the generous fruit of the annual
tree at the farm-house, took secret satisfaction
in the unlooked-for fall of the little girl's pride,
and leaned to all sides to whisper. She even
stretched in front of the little girl to tell it to
a boy beyond. Not daring to speak plainly, she
resorted to pig-Latin. "Seegry," she cried,
pulling at his coat, "shegry ain'tgry gotgry
agry thinggry." But when the little girl, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
knew pig-Latin in all its various dialects,
turned angry, scornful eyes upon her, the
neighbor woman's daughter sat up and her
smile faded to a sickly blankness.</p>

<p>Santa Claus was now almost at the end of his
resources. The floor was bare about the churn,
and there remained only three or four parcels
in his arms. The teacher was despoiling the
tree of its pop-corn festoons and tossing them
gaily about. Already there was a sound of
crunching in the room, as the candy, nuts, and
fruit met their destined fate.</p>

<p>But all at once, with the last package, a long,
thick one, held up before his jovial face, Santa
Claus started, looked a second time at the writing
upon it, and then, with a jubilant laugh,
called out the little girl's name!</p>

<p>The children about her hushed on the instant,
and all eyes were turned upon her. The
pitying expression on her mother's face
changed to one of joy, and the eldest and the
youngest brothers slid off the coal-bins as if
they were possessed. The Swede boy and the
cattleman, who had each been busy blaming
himself for something worse than forgetfulness
or negligence, fairly beamed at the back
of the little girl's curly head.</p>

<p>Very deliberately she got up and stepped to
the platform. A smile curved her mouth, and
she carried her pink chin high. As she received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
her gift, she paused for one moment
to drop a dainty curtsy and to thank Santa
Claus, a proceeding which filled all the other
girls with envy, since they had omitted it.
Then she proudly took her seat, the long, thick
package in one hand. It was wrapped in brown
paper and tied with white string.</p>

<p>The little girl did not open the package; instead,
she sat quietly with it across her knee,
displaying, as if unconsciously, her name
printed in full across it in large letters that
strayed upward, and that were headed by a
"Miss" entirely of capitals. Under her name,
in glowing red ink, was written "Merry Christmas,"
and, farther down, the words: "There
are seven beautiful things in this box for
you.&mdash;S. C."</p>

<p>When the teacher had made her closing
speech, all rose to go. The little girl, as she
put on her cap and the big buffalo coat, was
the center of interest, for the children crowded
about her and handled her package. The
neighbor woman's daughter hung the closest,
and even put one arm around the little girl.
The latter did not seem to notice any one, but
put the package under her coat and joined her
mother.</p>

<p>When the pung drove up to the door the little
girl lost no time in getting into it. The eldest
and the youngest brothers followed her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The biggest and his mother tarried a little,
however, the one to speak to the Swede boy, the
other to accost the cattleman.</p>

<p>There was a teasing look in the biggest brother's
eyes as he gave the Swede boy a slap on
the back. "Good for you!" he said in an undertone;
"I'll never forget that, long 's I
live." The Swede boy tried to answer, hung
his head, and finally made off. The biggest
brother took up the reins and, while he waited,
continued to pick cotton from the lapels of his
overcoat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cattleman, coming out of the
school-house ready for his drive home, suddenly
found himself face to face with a tearful
little woman who gratefully seized his big
hands. "Oh, how <i>good</i> of you!" she cried;
"how thoughtful and good and kind! Thank
you! thank you!"</p>

<p>"What fer?" demanded the cattleman. "I
hain't done nothin', my dear lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will do to say," laughed the little
girl's mother through her tears, as she got into
the pung and pulled one corner of the tick over
her head.</p>

<p>The little girl was silent during the homeward
ride; and on their arrival, when the
family entered the kitchen, she dropped her
package beside the stove and began to take off
her coat and cap. Her mother and the biggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and the youngest brothers looked at her in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, pet lamb," her mother said at last,
"aren't you going to look at your presents?"
She picked up the package and carried it to
the table.</p>

<p>The little girl slowly shook her head. The
biggest brother saw that all the bravado and
indifference shown at the school-house were
gone. In their place was a look of keen pain.
He lifted her and held her on his lap, guessing,
all at once, the secret of the seven gifts. "My
baby sister!" he said, and trusted himself to
speak no further. She understood, and put
her head against his breast.</p>

<p>The youngest brother, spurred by curiosity,
was opening the package. His mother stood
beside him. As the brown paper fell away at
the severing of the white string, he sprang back
with an exclamation of surprise. The biggest
brother put the little girl to one side, got up,
and stepped across to look down at the contents
thus disclosed.</p>

<p>He was reminded of the rear half of the attic,
where for years had been gathering odds and
ends. There was a bit of torn and faded mosquito-netting,
an old mouth-organ, a broken
domino, a pair of half-worn mittens, a ten-penny
nail, a dog-eared copy of "Alice in
Wonderland," and a slate-pencil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"My daughter!" said the little girl's mother,
light breaking in upon the situation; "my
brave little daughter!" She turned to breathe
a mother's comfort.</p>

<p>But the little girl, her cap and coat resumed,
was disappearing into the chill shadows of the
sitting-room.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>THE FATE OF A CROWING HEN</h3>


<div class='cap'>"SASSY" was all that her name implied.
From the very beginning, when, as a small
white egg, innocent enough in appearance, she
left the hand of the little girl's mother and
joined nine companions under a fat cochin, it
was with something of an impudent roll that
she gained her place in the nest. Three weeks
later, after having been faithfully sat upon,
and as faithfully turned each day by the
cochin's beak, she gave another pert stir, very
slight, and tapped a hole through her cracking
shell. The next morning she swaggered forth,
a round, fluffy, cheeping morsel.</div>

<p>She was not Sassy yet, however. It was
later, when she lost her yellow down and grew
a scant coat of white feathers, through which
her skin showed in pimpled, pinkish spots, that
she displayed the characteristics that christened
her, and, by her precocity and brazenness,
distinguished herself from among her
leghorn brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>At this period of her life, a pullet in both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
months and experience, she should have conducted
herself with becoming modesty. Instead,
she developed a habit of taking her
meals, morning, noon, and night, from the
kitchen table, to which the little girl did not
usually go until long after the big brothers had
finished and withdrawn. Sassy made her
entrance either by way of the hall or through
the window nearest the stove. Once inside, she
hopped to a bench, and thence to the oil-cloth.
Her progress from one end of the board to the
other was always attended by serious damage
to the butter, of which she was inordinately
fond. When, having fared well, she at last descended,
she paraded up and down, with many
sharp, inquiring cries of "C-a-w-k? c-a-w-k?
c-a-w-k?" and wherever her claws chanced to
touch left little, buttery fleurs-de-lis on the floor.
She escaped the disastrous fire, not, like a
dozen other fowls, by seeking refuge in the
wind-break, but because she was in the coal-shed
carrying on a hand-to-hand conflict with
the tortoise-shell cat, who had five new babies.</p>

<p>By Thanksgiving day, having developed into
a juicy frier, more prone than ever to snoop,
family opinion turned against her, so that
when it came to the question which chickens,
in view of the shortage of feed, should occupy
the oven in place of the usual sizzling turkey,
the big brothers and the little girl voted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the heads of Sassy and of a certain mysterious
young rooster who, though disturbing,
had never been definitely singled out, since, on
hearing his falsetto crow and looking about for
him, the family invariably came upon the insolent
pullet, alone and unconcerned.</p>

<p>The day before Thanksgiving the little girl
was directed to capture both the rooster and
Sassy. For the first, she selected a young
leghorn that she believed to be the guilty trumpeter
and poked him into a box-coop beside the
smoke-house. Then she set about jailing the
culpable pullet. She was aided by Godfrey,
the biggest brother's pet pointer, who scented
Sassy in the vegetable patch, where she was
scratching around the tomato vines. Together
they pursued her at top speed, Godfrey keeping
close to his bird, but, in true sportsmanlike
fashion, refraining from seizing her. Through
the tomatoes they ran, till the little girl sat
down from sheer exhaustion, with Godfrey
panting beside her and the pullet perched near
by on a pile of seed onions.</p>

<p>After a ten minutes' rest, the little girl and
the pointer renewed their chase. This time
Sassy left the tomato patch (foolishly enough,
for the vines tripped the little girl), and fled,
with hackles spread, toward the well, where a
flock was dipping water. When they saw her
coming, the chickens, among which were several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
young leghorns, fled in terror toward the
sorghum patch and lost themselves in its woody
lanes. Godfrey and the little girl charged this
western jungle with zest, thrashing about until
the pullet&mdash;supposedly&mdash;emerged and flitted
toward the sod barn. But when for the second
time, and after a lengthy hunt that brought up
at the new stacks, they paused for breath, the
little girl discovered, to the mystification of the
pointer, who did not know one leghorn from
another, and to her own disgust, that since their
threading of the sorghum they had been after
the wrong chicken!</p>

<p>The little girl sprawled on the sunny side
of a stack for an hour or two after that, and
chewed straws. She pulled off her shoes to
rest her stockingless feet, and put her head on
Godfrey's damp side. For she had resolved to
postpone the catching of Sassy till evening,
when the elusive pullet would be sleepily seated
on a two-by-four in the empty cow-stall that
now served for a coop.</p>

<p>When the early November twilight fell upon
the farm-yard, the little girl roused Godfrey
by gently pulling his tail and skipped round to
the barn door. Under ordinary circumstances,
the task of creeping upon an unsuspecting
chicken and seizing it for the block would have
been unpleasant. But, influenced by her long
dislike of the pullet, and recalling her tiresome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
experience of the afternoon, she chuckled to
think that she would soon have her hands
clasped tightly about Sassy's yellow legs.
"I'll not make a mistake <i>this</i> time," she said
to herself.</p>

<p>She entered the barn slyly and stole down
behind the stalls until she came opposite the
perches. The chickens were settling themselves
for the night, moving and murmuring
drowsily. As she peeped among them, her
glance fell upon Sassy, outlined against the
small square window beyond and roosted comfortably
with her beak toward the manger, all
unconscious of her nearing doom. The little
girl was certain that it was she, for there was
no mistaking the rakish lop of the serrated
comb, or the once white under-feathers soiled
to a bluish cast.</p>

<p>The little girl waited, restraining the excited
pointer, until the light had faded from the
square window. It was then so dark that the
chickens could not see the malevolent fingers
that, thrust softly up among them, grabbed a
leghorn's shanks; and there was only a mildly
concerned "k-r-r-r!" from an old, watchful
hen as the little girl retreated, one hand doing
almost fatal duty around an ill-starred neck.</p>

<p>By the time that the little girl, triumphantly
bearing both her prey, heads down, reached the
mounting-log at the front door of the house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
where the eldest brother awaited her with the
hatchet, it was nearly as dark outside as it had
been in the barn. So the eldest brother&mdash;for the
little girl had hurried away after giving him
the chickens&mdash;could not tell which leghorn suffered
the guillotine first. His sanguinary work
being done, the little girl returned and carried
the dead fowls into the coal-shed, where she
tied their toes together and hung them over
a nail.</p>

<p>Early next morning the eldest brother was
awakened by a prolonged falsetto crow,&mdash;the
familiar disturbing salute of the chanticleer
he had beheaded the night before! Puzzled
and wondering, he got up, ran to the eastern
window of the attic, and looked down upon the
yard. An amazing discovery repaid his
promptness. For, as the chicken once more
raised its voice, he saw that the mysterious
rooster was still alive! So was Sassy! They
were combined in one and the same bird! Two
innocent chickens had been sacrificed!</p>

<p>So, until the next spring,&mdash;the spring following
the fire, and one ever memorable for its
wonderful grass and flowers, its gentle rains
and windless, sunny days,&mdash;Sassy continued to
exasperate the family, winning only censure.
But when the depleted flock could not furnish
half the eggs the family needed, she took it
upon herself to lay one daily, and was considerate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
ate enough to render it unnecessary for the
little girl to go out and bring it in, by depositing
it in the hay-twist box behind the kitchen
stove, in the linen-barrel in the entry, or on the
canopied bed. Then she found an appreciative
friend in the little girl's mother, who, whenever
she heard a proud, discordant announcement,
half crow, half cackle, blessed the little white
hen as she hurried to secure the offering.</p>

<p>One afternoon during Sassy's career of prolificacy,
the little girl remembered that her
best thick dress was so threadbare that she
would need a brand-new one for the next winter.
She found, too, that if she was to have
one she must devise a way to swell the small
amount in the tin savings-bank; for the big
brothers declared they would be able only to
pay the heavy debt upon the farm and victual
the house for the stormy months to follow. So
she hit upon the idea of raising chickens, and
broached it to her mother. The latter, remembering
the sorry Christmas just past, at once
presented her with Sassy, promising that all
the eggs the leghorn laid should be credited to
the little girl at the general merchandise store
at the station, and that all the chicks hatched
out by Sassy should go the same way.</p>

<p>The little girl was jubilant over the plan, and
each morning answered the "cut-cut-c't-a-a-ah-cut"
of her hen with a gift of crumbs, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
took possession of the new-laid egg, placing it
carefully in a cracker-box. When, at the end
of as many days, a dozen eggs lay side by
side, she took them out, wrapped each one in
paper, packed them all in a lard-bucket full of
shorts, and, mounting the blue mare, rode to
the station, where she had the satisfaction of
seeing eleven cents put opposite her name in
the egg-book at the general merchandise store.</p>

<p>This was repeated four times, and, the price
of eggs having gone up a few cents in each interval,
the little girl had sixty cents to put in
her bank, which raised her total to one dollar
fifty-nine. On her June birthday the family
presented her with four dimes; the week after
she sold a wooden squirt-gun to the neighbor
woman's son for five cents. It was then plain
that, if Sassy should continue to furnish eggs
faithfully, the dress was assured.</p>

<p>But at this happy juncture, and, womanlike,
without a single cluck of warning, the leghorn
ceased her diurnal laying, and, after a
spasmodic week, during which she scattered
three or four eggs on the little girl's bed, gave
no further sign of justifying her existence.</p>

<p>The little girl was in despair, and at once
confided Sassy's delinquency to the eldest brother,
who knew a great deal about chickens.
He said that a leghorn was an all-year-round
layer, and that when a hen of the breed failed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to uphold the standard of her kind she was fit
only for broiling. The youngest brother, overhearing
the account of Sassy's conduct and the
eldest brother's comments, volunteered the
opinion that nothing ailed the chicken but the
pip, and advised fat and pepper. But when
three days had gone by and the leghorn, with
generous doses of axle-grease and cayenne,
ailed rather than recovered, the little girl
ceased her administrations.</p>

<p>It occurred to her, in the midst of her worry,
that perhaps Sassy wanted to set. Accordingly
she got ten eggs together, arranged them in a
nest, caught the hen, and put her upon them.
But here a new and unlooked-for thing happened.
Sassy would not stay on the nest. Not
at all daunted, the little girl procured a broad
strip of calico and tied the hen down. But in
her struggles to get free, Sassy broke nearly
all of the eggs under her, and finally hied herself
out of the new coop and over the smoke-house
to liberty.</p>

<p>Unhappy that her leghorn thus spurned to
mother a brood, the little girl sought the biggest
brother. "Oh, no wonder the mean thing
crows," she said to him, as she told her story.</p>

<p>The biggest brother conferred long and solemnly
on the question. When it was settled,
the little girl came out of the sitting-room with
a look of hopeful determination upon her face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and hunted up Sassy. The latter had grown
so bold since the Thanksgiving before that any
one could pick her up without running after
her. So the little girl, in two winks, had her
under one arm and was on her way to the carnelian
bluff.</p>

<p>It was a hot, sultry day in midsummer, and
not a breath of wind was blowing over the
farm. The grain-fields were still. The blades
of the corn drooped limply. The creamy sap
of the milkweed growing in the timothy meadow
was drying up in the stem. Below the bluff
the herd stood, belly deep, lashing about them
with wet tails, and the pigs wallowed among
the wilting bulrushes in damp security.</p>

<p>Yet, with all its heat and quiet, the afternoon
was destined to be a stormy one. The swallows
were flying low across the farm-yard;
the colts, pestered by busy flies, were moving
restlessly about the wire pen; the Maltese cat
was trying her claws on a table leg in the
kitchen; and, behind the wind-break, a collie
had given over a beef-bone and was industriously
eating grass. But all these signs, which
should have foretold to her what was coming,
were unnoticed by the little girl as she hurried
along.</p>

<p>At the southern base of the bluff she halted
and put Sassy on the ground with her head
pointing up the hill. Then, with apron held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
wide, she began to shoo the hen gently toward
the summit. For the biggest brother had said
very emphatically that the only way to make a
chicken lay is to drive her up a hill.</p>

<p>Sassy did not pay any attention to the apron,
but shook her wattles crossly, "k-r-r-red," and
held her head so that one white ear lobe lay
questioningly uppermost.</p>

<p>"Now you go up," commanded the little
girl; "go right straight up, or I'll just <i>give</i> it
to you. <i>I'll</i> make you lay, you lazy thing!"</p>

<p>Sassy tilted her head so that the opposite
ear lobe showed, and lifted one foot against
her breast. Otherwise she did not indicate that
she had even heard her orders. Her disobedience
angered the little girl.</p>

<p>"Shoo! shoo! shoo!" she cried; "do you
think I'm going to carry you? No, siree!
You'll walk,&mdash;every step of it, too. <i>I'll</i> teach
you." She seized Sassy by the tail and rudely
shoved her forward.</p>

<p>It availed no more than the shooing. The
hen not only refused to advance, but turned and
flew into the corn. When, after chasing her
around a dozen hills, the little girl once more
had the leghorn held tightly in her hands, she
gave her a good shaking. But no matter how
hard the little girl jerked her body from side to
side, Sassy, by bending her neck, kept her head
defiantly in one place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl was at her wits' end. The biggest
brother had specified that Sassy should
be driven; but the leghorn would not drive.
The little girl had tried her best to carry out
her instructions, and had only discovered the
truth of the old adage about leading a horse to
water. She could bring Sassy to the very spot
where a cure could be effected&mdash;and the hen
would refuse treatment. Chagrined, warm,
and discouraged, she resolved to carry the
chicken bodily to the stone-pile, a bare half
way, and there think over her failure. So, with
Sassy under her arm once more, she toiled up
the grassy slope.</p>

<p>While she was lying beside the pile, worried
and distraught, with the leghorn at close quarters
throwing up dirt and pebbles, the air became
so ominously and deathly still that the
little girl and Sassy fairly gasped for breath.
Over the grass tops the heat halted and lay in
long, faintly visible waves, like a ghostly sea.
And in the west there began to arise, silently
and swiftly, a vast mountain of peculiar, dense
arched clouds.</p>

<p>It bulged upward until its top seemed half
way to the sun. Then, with lightning rapidity,
it closed in at its middle and assumed the shape
of a monster toad-stool, and traveled forward
toward the Vermillion with a mighty roar.</p>

<p>The little girl neither saw nor heard it as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
came on. She was thinking, with the hopefulness
of youth, over Sassy's future possibilities.
"She'll surely start laying again some time,"
she mused, "and I'll borrow a hen from mother
to set on the eggs. So I'll have all those
chickens, and when they grow up I'll have all
their eggs, and some of them will set, and&mdash;"
She lost herself in an endless chain of computation.</p>

<p>The toad-stool, topped with angry, boiling
clouds, was now but five or six miles away. It
swayed like the trunk of an elephant as it
darted forward, one second touching the
ground, the next lifting itself into the air, shifting
and lowering as if it were picking spots
upon which to alight. A breeze sprang up and
hurried to meet it, and all the grass and corn-stalks
bowed that way.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rustling about her made the little
girl look up. The bright sunshine had
changed to threatening gloom, the sultry quiet
was broken by whispers of tempest and rain.
She saw the nearing cloud-column, now an
hour-glass in form, and realized her awful danger.
Calling to Sassy, she got up on her knees
with the thought of flight.</p>

<p>Sassy answered with little joyous cries. She
was gratefully welcoming the forerunning
breeze of the cyclone by raising her wings, and
was walking sidewise down the hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment, a torrent of water struck
the little girl as she attempted to get to her
feet, and rolled Sassy farther away from the
pile. Then, with a horrid growl, the cyclone
crossed the river, skipped over the swaying
wheat, and, alighting on the edge of the corn,
dragged its ravaging base across the field with
a terrific whirling of stalks and a rending and
grinding that bespoke the very end of things.
Its center was midway between the bluff and
the farm-house. And, as its farther edge
braided the cottonwoods in the wind-break and
uprooted the stunted apple-trees, its near edge
came close to the stone-pile with a mighty sucking
breath.</p>

<p>The little girl, seeing that escape was impossible,
for the rain was beating her down, flung
herself in the lee of the pile and clutched
at the grass. "Sassy!" she shouted again;
"Sassy!" But the cyclone drowned her cry.</p>

<p>With starting eyes she saw the swirling currents
draw Sassy, maelstromlike, in and in.
The hen lost her feet, was next tossed like a
white ball hither and thither, and then sped
out of sight into the vortex of the storm's wild
mingling of matter, taking with her all the little
girl's hopes of future revenue&mdash;the unlaid eggs
and the unhatched chicks. As she disappeared,
she gave a final frightened, crowing cluck. It
was her swan song.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the tornado had swept on, leaving in
its wake a wide path of bare ground fringed
with wreckage, the little girl hurried home to
assure herself that her mother and the big brothers
had gotten into the storm-cellar, and that
the blue mare was unhurt, and to gaze into the
sitting-room mirror to see if her hair had
turned white. Satisfied upon all points, she
changed her clothes and started eastward on
horseback, following the streaked road of the
cyclone. As she traveled, she kept steadfastly
on the lookout, and jogged along until the
prairie was wrapped in night. When, at last,
she turned and started back, she carried, as
trophies of her search, her mother's wooden
chopping-bowl, dusty and unharmed, and,
thrust in her hat-band, a solitary memento of
the vanished crowing hen, a broken, soiled
white feather.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<h3>THE RESERVATION TRIP</h3>


<div class='cap'>A HUGE pen with V-shaped wings, patterned
after those built by the Indians to
imprison antelope, thrust its long, high neck
over the railroad embankment and against the
open doors of the cattle-cars as they were rolled
along the siding. Through the pen and up the
jutting neck into the stifling, wheeled boxes,
lowing in fright and advancing unwillingly,
were driven the Dutchman's fat steers and the
beeves belonging to the cattleman. When a
long train was filled with them, a wildcat engine
backed down from the station, coupled on
to the waiting freight, and went lumbering
away with its hungry, thirsty load, bound for
a packing-house in a distant city.</div>

<p>The little girl watched the shipping of the
stock, her heart sore with the thought that only
a short week stood between the home herd and
the shambles. Never before had she mourned
the departure of the cattle, for, spared the long
ride in foul, torturing confinement, they had
simply disappeared across the prairie in the direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of Sioux Falls or Yankton, contentedly
feeding as they went, and with the three big
brothers riding slowly behind them. It had
always been the same with the sheep. But now
there rang continually in her ears the piteous
bleating of the little flock she had learned to
love through the summer months, and that,
lured by a treacherous bell-wether, had passed
through the pen, some days before, and crossed
the long, high Bridge of Sighs.</p>

<p>But what she feared for the animals yet to be
sold never came to pass. The morning before
the big brothers were to round-up, a trooper
rode in from the reservation with an urgent
message from the new commandant, asking
that as many head of beeves as possible be sent
to the post. The letter stated that a stock-raiser,
with whom negotiations had been all
but closed, had received an offer from a Kansas
City buyer that advanced the army terms by a
fraction of a cent per pound on the hoof. The
commissary, therefore, was compelled to look
elsewhere for meat.</p>

<p>A reply was at once sent back, promising
a drove from the farm-house within a week.
And as the little girl saw the cavalry horse
speeding westward with the message, she flew
into the kitchen with a happy song on her lips
and set about helping her mother prepare provisions
for the trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon, while the biggest and the
youngest brothers divided the cattle, putting
those that were to be wintered into the wire
pen, the eldest shod four ponies, three for riding
and one for a pack-horse. The start was
planned for the next day, and since the trip
must be a leisurely one in order that the animals
should arrive in as good condition as
when they set out, a cow was included in the
drove to furnish milk during the two days or
more that the big brothers would be en route.</p>

<p>But the following morning all plans for the
journey were upset. One of the ponies tried
its newly shod heels on the youngest brother
with such viciousness that he had to be carried
into the house. The biggest brother decided to
remain at home and take care of him. So,
while the pack-horse was being loaded with
blankets, food, and a coffee-pot, the eldest brother
and his mother discussed the situation and
at last agreed that the little girl would have to
help in the drive.</p>

<p>It was the fall before the little girl's thirteenth
birthday, and she was wearing her hair
in a braid and her dresses to her shoe-tops.
That summer, for the first time in her life, she
had not gone barefoot. She had also taken to
riding a side-saddle with a red plush seat.
When her mother, therefore, suggested that the
trip would be a hard one, that the post was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
rough place, and that, since the colonel's family
had gone to a new fort in Wyoming, there was
no house on the reservation at which she could
stay overnight, the eldest brother pooh-poohed
and declared that the little girl was no baby
and that very good accommodations could be
secured at a hotel near the barracks.</p>

<p>They started immediately after dinner, taking
two dogs along, and crossed the Vermillion
to the West Fork. There the cattle were
brought to a stand and a camping-place was
selected. They were still so near the farm that
the eldest brother, anxious to know how matters
were at home, induced the little girl to return
to the farm-house for the night. She did
so, and joined him before sunrise next morning.</p>

<p>There was a worried look on her face as she
came galloping up, and the eldest brother, fearful
that the youngest was worse, demanded the
news.</p>

<p>"Everything's just as it was when we left,"
said the little girl, "only mother's awfully
scared about my going, because the Swede
told her last night, when he heard that I was
gone, that the hotel at the post is an awful
place, full of gamblers and thieves. Two or
three men that had money have disappeared
there, and never been seen since. The Swede
says he thinks the proprietor isn't any better
than he should be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that Swede's a regular croaker," replied
the eldest brother. "'Fraid as death of
his own shadow. I can take care of you and
myself and the money to boot. Needn't to fret
while I've got my pistols handy."</p>

<p>"Well, mother says," added the little girl,
"that she hopes nothing happens to the money,
because it'll finish putting us in as good shape
as we were before the fire. She doesn't think
anybody'd hurt us, exactly."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about the hotel after
that, and the little girl soon forgot her disquiet
in the pleasures of the trip. She had made it
but two or three times since the return from
her christening, and had always gone so fast
in the light wagon or the buckboard that she
had no time to enjoy the changing scenery.
Now they were not keeping to the main road,
and she saw landmarks and farms that were
new to her as they traveled from the West Fork
to the "Jim," and on to the Missouri.</p>

<p>That night the eldest brother pitched camp
on a hillock not far from the herd and well out
of way of the mosquitos. To make the little
girl's safety certain, he put her blankets at the
center of a square that was roped in by lariats,
the stakes being black willows cut from a clump
on the river bank. She lay down with the dogs
beside her, but, unused to the strangeness of
her bed, slept little. The eldest brother stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
with the herd, so she passed the long hours before
midnight looking up at the stars and
thinking.</p>

<p>She could hear the yelping of some coyotes
that were cautiously reconnoitering from a
neighboring bluff. When they came near, the
dogs sprang up and challenged them, and soon
their cries died away as they slunk down
a deep coul&eacute;e. The dogs quieting again, she
caught the sound of faint movements and calls
in the grass. An owl hooted, and it was so like
the signal-cry of some prowling Blackfeet who
had visited the farm one night that she was
startled and sat up. A bird chirped and a
rabbit hopped by. Down among the cattle a
steer coughed, or grunted as it got awkwardly
to its feet. And there was an occasional click
of horn against horn as an animal moved its
head. At last all the sounds blended and faded,
and she fell asleep, lulled by the song that the
eldest brother was singing to the herd.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the following afternoon,
though they had gone at a grazing pace since
sun-up, they arrived in sight of the post and
halted a mile away from the nearest dugout.
The little girl and the dogs remained with the
cattle while the eldest brother cantered in to
report his arrival. When he returned, a young
lieutenant came with him to inspect the drove;
and by six o'clock the beeves had been declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
satisfactory and were in a stockade pen behind
the barracks. Then the eldest brother, his belt
heavy with good government coin, rode with
the little girl toward the hotel, a rough, one-story
building flanked on either side by a gambling-house.</p>

<p>They ate their supper in the small, unpapered
parlor which adjoined the bar, for the eldest
brother had looked into the dining-room and
found it as thick with smoke and men as the saloon.
When the meal, which was served by an
Indian woman, was over, the little girl remained
quietly in her chair while the eldest brother
went out to sell the pack-pony. He returned
late, delighted over making a fine bargain with
a Canadian fur-trader, to find her waiting patiently
but tremblingly for him.</p>

<p>"Oh, they've been making such a terrible
noise in the saloon," she told him, as she
sprang up to let him in. "I locked the door
because I was scared. I could hear swearing
and quarreling, and poker chips rattling
around."</p>

<p>He did not answer until he had carefully hidden
the price of the pony in his belt. Then he
put his revolvers on the table and drew a chair
close to hers.</p>

<p>"I just met Eagle Eye," he whispered, "an'
he says that what the Swede told ma is true.
This hotel's a tough place, and the man that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
runs it 's got a bad name. It's full of gamblers
now, too, because the troopers have just been
paid. I don't like to think of bunkin' here to-night
one bit. Pretty nearly every man knows
I've got a lot of money on me. But what c'n
we do?"</p>

<p>The little girl knit her brows. "We might
stay right in this room," she whispered at last.
"You could bring in the blankets and I'd
watch while you slept a little while; and then
you could watch till morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess it ain't so bad as all that."</p>

<p>"Or we could ride toward home and camp.
I'm not tired, and I'd rather ride than stay
here, especially alone in a room."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I don't intend to let you stay
alone in a room," declared the eldest brother.
"But there's no use of our tryin' to start
home to-night. We couldn't get off without
somebody knowin' about it, and I don't want
any cutthroat Indians after me. If we had
fresh horses it'd be a different thing. We'd
lead 'em a run for the farm. But the ponies
are tired. We'll start home in the mornin',
and I'll get this wad into a safe at the station
before night." He tapped his belt.</p>

<p>A knock brought him to his feet. On opening
the door, the hotel man stood before him.
"I suppose you folks want a brace of rooms,"
he said, taking in the revolvers with a swift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
glance of his little, deep-set eyes. "I can give
you two that have a door between. Only ones
I've got left. Had to put Pinky Jackson into
the barn to clear one of 'em. And he's a
reg'lar boarder, too." He looked the little girl
up and down so searchingly that she shrank
behind the eldest brother.</p>

<p>The eldest brother took up his revolvers.
"One room'll do us," he said. "We'll jus'
camp like we did on the prairie last night. Sister's
a little bit nervous; couldn't think of
puttin' her off by herself. Give us a room with
a shake-down, and I'll roll up in some blankets
on the floor."</p>

<p>The hotel man slapped the eldest brother on
the back. "You're the right kind of a brother,"
he cried heartily; "like to see it. We
men kind o' forget, living out in these wilds,
how scarey and tender girls are. Come along,
I've got the very room for you." He picked
up the lamp, crossed the crowded saloon, between
card-tables full of men, and led the way
down a long passage. The eldest brother and
the little girl followed close at his heels, scarcely
giving a glance to the gaping crowd in the bar.</p>

<p>The room into which they were shown was
at the very end of the passage and in the rear
part of the house. It was uncarpeted, and its
ceiling was so low that the eldest brother could
reach up and touch it with the flat of his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
A wide, rough bedstead occupied one side;
against the opposite wall stood a cot of the
kind used in military camps. A chair with a
rawhide bottom completed the furniture. The
door from the passage was the only one leading
into the room. There were no windows at all,
but at one end a casing had been boarded up.
The eldest brother, after a quick survey, remarked
the lack of light.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," explained the hotel man,
"this room originally looked out on the yard.
But when I built on a lean-to, the window was
closed. Won't make any difference to you, will
it? Heard you were going to leave early."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the eldest brother. He took
the lamp and set it on the floor. When the hotel
man had given a last sharp look around, he
went out and closed the door.</p>

<p>Without losing a moment, the little girl, who
was wearied with her long day's ride, put some
matches within easy reach and flung herself
down in her clothes on the cot. But the eldest
brother, after rolling the bedstead against the
door, examined the window to make sure that
it was nailed fast, and gently tapped the walls
to see that no spot gave back the hollow sound
that would suggest a secret entrance. Satisfied
that all was safe, he unbuckled his belt, put it
under the blankets at the little girl's feet, and
extinguished the light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then past eleven, but the hotel was
still awake and noisy. The eldest brother concluded
that it would be well to get a short nap
at once and remain awake throughout the
hours when, the bar-room being deserted, any
attempt to molest him would be made. The little
girl was already breathing deeply. He
threw himself across the bed, his pistols beside
him.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had been asleep
when he found himself wide awake and conscious
that some one was moving softly toward
him. He struggled to spring up, half convinced
that he was having a nightmare, but his
body refused to obey. All at once, as he lay
silently looking upward, a man arose from beside
the bed and leaned over him.</p>

<p>A dim light, which seemed to come from the
rear, brought out the menacing figure plainly.
One arm was half raised as if to strike. It was
evident that the assassin was in doubt, since
the headboard shaded the bed, as to whether
the eldest brother or the little girl was stretched
before him. The next instant he knew, for the
eldest brother twisted in agony at sight of the
arm poised above him and uttered a groan.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash the figure swayed toward
him and the arm descended. But the eldest
brother was quicker. He rolled sidewise, and
at the same time struck out with his right hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
There was the sound of a dull blow not made
by his fist, a scream from the little girl, and the
thump of the eldest brother's body as he struck
the floor on the farther side of the bed.</p>

<p>Intense stillness followed. The eldest brother,
a revolver in either hand, got cautiously
to his knees and peered across to where his assailant
had stood. The dim light was gone
now, however, and he could make out nothing.
He waited, holding his breath, to see if any one
were creeping upon him from under or around
the bed. Hearing nothing but a sob from the
little girl, he at last arose to his feet, his eyes
and his weapons on the alert, and stepped back
against the wall. Then he sidled along until,
having passed the boarded-up window and two
corners, his knees struck the cot.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said, squatting instantly
to one side to dodge any bullet or knife
that might be guided by his voice. After another
short wait he added, "I think he's gone.
Light the lamp."</p>

<p>While the match flickered in the little girl's
hand, the eldest brother again moved eyes and
pistols in a half-circle. But as the lamp was
lifted and its light dispelled the darkness, he
saw that they were alone. To remove every
doubt, he looked under the bed and the cot and
behind the headboard. When his search was
completed he sat down on the rawhide-bottomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
chair, trembling, enraged, and mystified.</p>

<p>"Am I crazy?" he asked in a low voice. "I
was sure there was a man in here. But if there
was, how'd he get out?"</p>

<p>"I heard some one," whispered the little
girl. She was very pale, and kept close beside
him for protection.</p>

<p>The eldest brother thought a moment. Then
he jumped up and strode over to the bed.
"Bring the lamp," he said.</p>

<p>Together they examined the covers. Only
the top one had been turned down. Now it lay
as the eldest brother had tossed it when he
rolled out upon the floor. The other blankets
were undisturbed. He ran his fingers over
them carefully.</p>

<p>Suddenly he uttered a cry and began to fold
them back swiftly, finding on each the trace he
sought. When the mattress was at last laid
bare, he pointed to a narrow slit that did not
penetrate to the under side.</p>

<p>"It was a knife," said the little girl, and the
lamp almost fell from her grasp.</p>

<p>The eldest brother nodded, dragged the bed
away from the door, and flung it wide. The
passage was dark and still, apparently empty.
"Hello!" he shouted at the top of his lungs.
"Hello, there!"</p>

<p>As the sound of his voice died away, a distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
door creaked and the hotel man came out
in his underclothes, a candle in his hand.
"What's the matter?" he called crossly, coming
toward them. "You'll wake the whole
house." He looked around, a trifle dismayed,
the eldest brother thought, to see other doors
being opened and heads thrust out.</p>

<p>"That's just what I intend to do," cried the
eldest brother. "I want to let every man in
the hotel know that you keep a murderer handy
to stab people in their sleep!"</p>

<p>The proprietor was now close. He brought
up abruptly at the daring accusation and
glared at the eldest brother. "Don't you give
me any such talk as that," he said. His teeth
came together with a snap, and he reached instinctively
to the place where, in the daytime,
was the pocket that held a ready pistol.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare deny it," answered the eldest
brother. He brought a revolver in line with
the hotel man's eyes. "Do you see that?" he
queried. "Well, just be very careful, and come
here. I want to show you something." He
motioned the other to precede him. Together
they entered the bedroom. A curious crowd
followed and filled the apartment. "Now,"
went on the eldest brother, "look at that bed."</p>

<p>One by one they stepped forward, ran their
fingers through the slits in the covers, smiled
grimly, and backed away to whisper among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
themselves. The hotel man did like the rest,
only his smile was pacifying, cringing.</p>

<p>When all had had their turn, the eldest brother
faced the crowd. "I heard last night,"
he said, "that more 'n one man has hired a
room in this hotel and never been seen again.
So I shoved my bed against the door, before I
went to sleep, to make sure we'd be safe. That
knife cut shows how safe we was." He seized
the proprietor roughly by the shoulder.
"There's a remedy for holes like this. Like as
not, these gentlemen know about it." There
was a murmur of assent from the listening
crowd. "Now I'll give you jus' a minute to
show the gentlemen where that secret entrance
is that I looked for last night. Then we'll talk
remedy."</p>

<p>He cocked a pistol, his fingers still on the
hotel man's shoulder, and held the eyes of the
latter steadily. They stood thus for a moment,
face to face.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about a secret entrance,"
growled the hotel man at last, with an
oath. "But if you'll take your hand off me
and put down that shooting-iron, I'll help
you hunt it, if there is one."</p>

<p>The eldest brother did as he was asked, and
the hotel man began to walk about, looking
above him, examining the walls, scrutinizing
the floor. Soon all the rest were similarly occupied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
even the eldest brother taking his eyes
off his host to search the boards at his feet.</p>

<p>The opportunity for which the hotel man
was waiting came. While the attention of all
was diverted, he moved around until he was opposite
the door, and then slipped through it
with a defiant yell. Down the dark passage he
fled, and gained its farther end before the eldest
brother, with the crowd behind him, took up
the chase. Shots were fired at haphazard into
the gloom. But when the hotel had been carefully
searched, no proprietor was to be found.
His pursuers, certain that he was hidden in
some closet known only to himself, adjourned
to the bar to discuss ways and means.</p>

<p>The news of the trouble at the hotel spread
like thistle-down in a high wind. In half an
hour the saloon was jammed with cattlemen,
traders, soldiers, gamblers, half-breeds, and Indians,
all more or less under the influence of
the absent proprietor's liquor, which was flowing
freely, and all ready to hear what the eldest
brother had to say.</p>

<p>He stood on the slippery counter to address
them, his weapons still in his hands. On one
side was a solitary lamp that brought out dimly
the faces upturned to him; on the other sat the
little girl, facing the mob as it waited, sinister,
determined, threatening, ready to act
upon any mad suggestion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>When the eldest brother had recounted his
story, he stood in silence, waiting for some one
to speak. After a short pause there was a
movement in the rear of the room, and, with a
jingle of spurs, there stepped forward Eagle
Eye, the scout.</p>

<p>He pulled off his slouch-hat and shook back
his long hair as he leaped to a place beside the
eldest brother. Then he put his hands to his
belt and stood, arms akimbo. "There's been
bad work here before," he said, "and we've
let it pass. But shall we let it pass this time?"
There were cries of "No, no," and curses on
the head of the hotel man. Eagle Eye went
on. "It's a dark night: the moon is down, and
the sun is slow a-rising. We had better have
a light to show us to our beds." There was a
hidden meaning in his voice that was read and
answered with cheers by the drunken mob.</p>

<p>"What say you, Langdon?" he continued,
whirling round upon a man on whose blue flannel
shirt shone a star and whose belt gave back
the glint of nickel.</p>

<p>Langdon gave a laugh and shrugged his
shoulders before draining the flask in his hand.</p>

<p>"This is my friend," said Eagle Eye, extending
one arm above the little girl and resting
it on the eldest brother's shoulder. "We
will help him drive the fox from the haystack."</p>

<p>Another cheer greeted him.   He jumped to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the floor, and the eldest brother followed, lifting
the little girl down beside him. The crowd,
eager for the vengeful finale, rushed out of the
bar to the street.</p>

<p>Eagle Eye hung back to whisper in the eldest
brother's ear. "It's a good time for you to
get out," he said. "I'll help you saddle the
ponies." He knelt to unfasten his spurs and
put them on the other's boots.</p>

<p>The eldest brother felt of his belt, grasped
the little girl's hand, and hurried out of a side
door with the half-breed. A soldier had carried
away the lamp to use it as a brand, and no
one saw them leave the darkened room. Once
in the stable, the work of getting the horses
ready took but a few moments. Then the eldest
brother and the little girl mounted and rode at
a walk toward the barracks, with Eagle Eye on
foot beside them and the dogs trotting after.</p>

<p>When they were so far that their horses'
hoof-beats could not be heard by the crowd,
they gave the half-breed a silent, grateful shake
of the hand and galloped rapidly toward home.
Not until the post was a mile behind did they
halt at the top of a ridge to look back.</p>

<p>Volleys of shots and shouting were borne to
their ears by the early morning breeze, for the
crowd was celebrating the progress of a swiftly
mounting blaze. Soon the eldest brother and
the little girl could see the men running excitedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
about, and caught the smell of kindling
lumber. In a few moments the post sprang
into sight as the hotel became a mass of flame.</p>

<p>The mob as it moved about the rim of the
burning pile, looked like wooden men pulled by
wires. There were fewer shots now and little
shouting. The conflagration seemed to glut the
horde. The eldest brother and the little girl
dared pause no longer, but cantered on. When
they looked around for the last time, the fire
had died down, and its thin smoke was carrying
up a myriad sparks, to die out in the dome
of the slowly brightening sky.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER MOUND ON THE BLUFF</h3>


<div class='cap'>COTTONWOOD leaves from the wind-break,
splashed with red from the wounds
of the frost, tarried at the window-panes to tap
gently, or went hurrying past the farm-house
with the north wind that was whining dolorously
under the wet gables, to find their way
through the branches of the ash-trees in front.
The crows strutted across the stubbled wheat,
spouting to one another over their finds. The
dead pea-vines in the vegetable garden screwed
about till they loosened their roots, and then
scampered up the furrowed potato-field as the
guardian of their gathered fruit flounced his
empty sleeves and ample coat-tails at them. A
family of robins that had dallied too long in
the north whirred over the corn-field, where
the shocks were standing in long, regular lines,
and called down a last crisp good-by to the
russet, plume-topped tents of autumn's invading
army.</div>

<p>But all the bleakness without, that November
morning, could not equal the bitterness within,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
though the iron tea-kettle was singing cheerily
enough over the hot coal fire in the sitting-room
stove, and the collies, to show their lazy appreciation
of cozy quarters, were thumping their
tails contentedly against the rag carpet. For,
with the eldest and the youngest brothers elk-hunting
beyond Fort Mandan, and the biggest
miles away at Yankton with a load of hogs,
the little girl, half dazed with anxiety, was
watching, alone save for the neighbor woman,
beside the canopied bed.</p>

<p>Her mother's illness had come with alarming
suddenness. The afternoon before she had
been apparently as well as usual, and when the
little girl went into her room for the night, was
humming to herself as she chopped up turnips
for the cows. But the neighbor woman, arriving
later in quest of a start of yeast, found her
lying still and speechless in the entry, where
she had been stricken at her work. Brandy had
revived her, and she had begun to recover her
strength. Yet it was plain to the neighbor woman
and the little girl, no matter how much the
sufferer strove to make light of her fainting,
that help was needed.</p>

<p>Throughout the forenoon the little girl
begged hard for permission to go to the station
for the new doctor. Her mother, seeing
through the windows how sunless and blustery
it was outside, entreated her to wait until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
next day, when the biggest brother would be
home. But the neighbor woman, who dreaded
a second attack, at last joined her arguments
to the little girl's, dwelling upon the uncertainty
of the brother's return; and shortly
after dinner the mother consented.</p>

<p>"If there were only some one else to send,"
she whispered as the little girl bent over her for
a parting embrace. "It is cold and stormy."</p>

<p>"It's getting colder every minute," was the
answer. "If I go at all, I must go now. I'll
take the sorrel and ride fast. And I'll be back
before you know it." She kissed her mother
tenderly and hastened from the house.</p>

<p>When she led her horse out of the barn and
mounted at a nail-keg near the tool-house, she
saw that her start had been delayed too long
and that she was threatened with a drenching.
The air was rapidly growing more chill, and
northward the sky was streaked in long, slanting
lines with a downfall that was advancing
toward the farm. She gave no thought to deferring
her trip, however, but sprang into the
saddle, and instead of taking the road leading
through the corn-shocks, started across the
fields toward the carnelian bluff.</p>

<p>To her dismay, her short cut resulted only in
a loss of time. When she passed through the
cottonwoods to the barley-field beyond, the
ground, still soaked from the recent rain, became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
so soft that the sorrel sank to his knees
at every step. He began to plunge excitedly,
and she guided him to the left, away from the
timothy meadow, to a firmer foothold on the
edge of the corn-field. It brought her out upon
the prairie at the western base of the hill.</p>

<p>As she crossed the southern slope, setting
her horse into a run with her whip, she chanced
to glance up toward the summit, and her eyes
met an unfamiliar object. The next moment,
despite her solicitude for her mother, the oncoming
storm and the long road ahead, she
reined him in so abruptly that he sat back upon
his haunches, and then urged him up the incline
to where, in place of the usual pile of
stones, was a low, dark mound of earth with a
pipestone cross at its head.</p>

<p>Halted beside the mound, her curiosity
changed to sudden awe; for, leaning from her
horse, she read aloud a word that imparted
painful knowledge carefully kept from her for
almost fourteen years,&mdash;a word that was chiseled
deep into the polished face of the cross:</p>

<div class='center'>
FATHER<br />
</div>

<p>Looking down thus, for the first time, at the
uncovered grave, no feeling of grief succeeded
her surprise and wonder. But instantly the
thought came that it was here, in happy ignorance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of the meaning of the pile, that every
spring and summer she had sat to watch the
big brothers at work in the fields, the gophers,
the birds, the herd in the slough below; to think
over her baby problems and sorrows; or to
build castles from a beloved book. She read
the chiseled word again, softly and reverently,
then backed the sorrel away and once more
rode on rapidly, making for the railroad and
sitting her horse with the tense erectness of a
trooper on parade.</p>

<p>All at once, a little way out on the prairie, a
terror seized her, and she began to lash the sorrel
with all her might. The black hillock behind,
with its graven head-mark, had borne to
her heart a new fear that perhaps her mother,
too, would soon sleep upon the hillside. She
put the thought of her father away, and centered
her efforts on reaching the station and
the doctor. As she galloped at breakneck
speed, the damp wind swept her face, cutting
it sharply, and whipped out her horse's mane
and tail till they fluttered on a level with the
saddle.</p>

<p>At the track she ceased striking the sorrel
and let him fall into a slow, steady canter. The
downpour was near now, sweeping south in
the strong grasp of a squall to cross her path.
She could see that its front was a sheet not of
rain, but of driving hail that rebounded high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
from the dry grass. She crouched in her seat
and pulled her hat far down to shield her face.</p>

<p>Before the sorrel made another quarter of a
mile, the hailstones had passed the ties and
were kicking up the soft dirt of the embankment
like a volley of shrapnel. When they
moved their fire forward to the wagon-road,
they almost hurled the little girl from her saddle.
She cried out in agony as the icy bullets
cleft the air and pounded her cruelly on head
and shoulders. A stone the size of a wild
duck's egg split the skin of her rein-hand, and
she dropped the bridle and let the sorrel go at
random. Squealing shrilly whenever a missile
reached his tender ears, he stayed in the road,
but stopped running, and whirled in a circle to
avoid his punishment. The little girl, though
she flinched under the shower, remained on his
back grittily and waited until the fall thinned
and suddenly ended.</p>

<p>Wounded from head to foot, she continued
her journey over a road deep with hail. When
the station came in sight, she stopped to wipe
the blood from a hurt on her cheek and to wind
her handkerchief around her injured hand.
Then she raced through town and left her message
at the doctor's door.</p>

<p>The doctor hitched up his buggy and, accompanied
by his wife, set off for the farm behind
the little girl, who at times rode anxiously far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in the lead, and, again, drew up and trotted beside
the vehicle to ask him to travel faster.
But when the farm-house was neared, she
could not bear to lag any longer, and gave the
sorrel the bit. As she passed the carnelian
bluff, she skirted it well, though she could not
see the mound or the cross. It had grown dark
and they were shrouded in stormy shadows.
But she kept her eyes continually in that direction,
and talked to the horse to quiet a nervous
throbbing in her breast that she did not
admit to herself. At the barn she unbuckled
the saddle and the bridle outside the door, let
the sorrel trot in alone, and ran toward the
kitchen.</p>

<p>When the doctor completed his diagnosis
that night, he told the little girl's mother only
what she had long known: that she might live
to see her daughter a grown woman and her
sons old men; that she might pass away before
the end of another week, or another day. The
little girl was not in the room to hear him, and
on returning later to the canopied bed, neither
her mother nor the neighbor woman repeated
his words. He was gone again, leaving only a
few pellets to check a possible sinking-spell.
For there was nothing else that could be done
at the farm-house&mdash;except wait and hope.</p>

<p>But, as if she divined by instinct what there
was to fear, the little girl stoutly refused to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
leave her mother that night and seek rest.
After prevailing upon the neighbor woman to
lie down on the lounge close by, she sat on the
carpet beside the bed, weary but unswerving,
and reached up every little while to touch a
hand, or rose to listen to the spasmodic beating
of the tortured heart.</p>

<p>At midnight her mother awoke and asked
for nourishment. Having eaten and drunk, she
motioned the little girl to a seat on the edge of
the bed and began to talk, slowly at the beginning
but more hurriedly toward the last, as if
she were freeing herself of something long ago
thought out and long delayed in the saying.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of the fields and hedges
of dear old England," she whispered. "I can
see them so plainly to-night. I have just been
there in my dreams, I think; and I have come
back to tell you how beautiful they are. Of
course the plains are beautiful, too,&mdash;beautiful
but lonely. England is dotted with homes, and
there are trees everywhere, and flowers so many
months of the year. Oh, one never could feel
lonely there."</p>

<p>She turned her face away and seemed to be
asleep. But presently she came back to the
little girl and took her hand with a smile.</p>

<p>"Years ago," she went on, "when I was a
hearty, happy girl, only two or three years
older than you are now, pet lamb, your father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and I came West and took up this farm.
Hardly anybody lived here in those days.
They were a few squatters; but they either
trapped in the winter and went away during
the summer, or hunted and farmed in the summer
and left in the fall. So life was very quiet,
quieter even than it is now, except that there
were Indians here by the hundreds. They stole
from us by night and shot our stock, and would
have murdered us only that they could get
more out of us by letting us live. They came
by in processions, put up their wigwams in our
very yard, and ate up everything we had in the
house. We dared not see the wrong they did.
I was often alone when they came, and I always
wondered if that would not be the last of me
and my little boys.</p>

<p>"But, though here and there men and women
and even little babies were tomahawked, we
were never harmed, for some reason; and, as
the years went by, people began to come and
settle near us. Then the post was established,
and we could go to church once a summer. I
went with the boys, because some one always
had to remain home to watch the farm. That
is why I never visited a town the first ten years
after we settled here. Then you came,&mdash;just
a few days&mdash;before&mdash;we lost&mdash;your&mdash;father."</p>

<p>The little girl smoothed back her mother's
hair lovingly. The time had come to tell of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
her discovery on the bluff. "I've seen it," she
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Her mother understood. "We wanted you
to find it out by yourself," she answered.
"The boys took away the stones and put up
the cross the night before they left." She
sighed and then went on:</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about you to-night&mdash;about
your future&mdash;in recalling my years here
on the plains. I am no longer young, pet lamb;
I was never very strong. I may not always be
with you." Her voice broke a little. She
tightened her grasp of the little girl's fingers.</p>

<p>"I do not worry about the boys. They will
marry and settle down among our good neighbors.
But you, my little girl, what will you do?
Not stay, I hope, hoeing and herding and working
your life out in the kitchen, with nothing
to brighten the days. I cannot bear to think of
that. I lived on here after your father was
taken because I feared the responsibility of
raising my boys in a great, strange city; and I
dreaded the thought of leaving your father's
grave. But now I often wonder if I have acted
for the best. Selfish in my grief and loss, have
I not deprived the boys of the advantages they
should have had? For you, it is not yet too
late.</p>

<p>"Whether I am taken from you or not, I
want you to leave the prairie and spend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
rest of your life where you can enjoy the best
things that life offers&mdash;music and pictures and
travel, and the friendship of cultivated people.
In twenty years&mdash;perhaps less, for the plains
are changing swiftly&mdash;all these level, fertile
miles will be covered with homes. Every
quarter-section will hold a house, and there
will be chimneys in sight in every direction.
Churches and better schools will follow. The
roads will be planted with trees. There will be
fences about the fields, and no Indians to thieve
and kill. And this valley, the 'Jim,' or the
Missouri, will not be the edge of civilization,
for the frontier will have moved far to the west.</p>

<p>"And yet, though I can see it all coming, I
am not willing for you to wait for it and spend
your young womanhood here. One woman in
a family is enough to sacrifice to the suffering
and drudgery of frontier life. So I want you
to go East, to go where the sweetest and best
influences can reach you. The prairie has
given you health. It has never given you happiness.
Your life, like that of every other child
on the plains, has had few joys and many little
tragedies. They say the city child ages fast;
but do they ever think of the wearing sameness
and starving of heart that puts years on the
country child? Ah! those who are born and
bred on the edge of things give more than the
work of their hands to the country's building."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>They sat in silence a long time, their hands
clasped. Then the little girl kissed her mother
softly. "I want to go, mother," she said, with
shining eyes. "I want to go away to school,
and you must go with me."</p>

<p>Her mother did not answer for a moment.</p>

<p>"'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,'"
she breathed at last. And not till long afterward,
when tears had worn the first keen edge
from her grief, did the little girl know the full
meaning of the promise.</p>

<p>"Pull back the curtains from the eastern
windows," said her mother; "I want to see the
sky. Is the night clear?"</p>

<p>"The stars are out, mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, I love the stars!"</p>

<p>"Are they the same ones that I'll see when&mdash;when&mdash;I'm
away from here?"</p>

<p>"The very same, pet lamb."</p>

<p>"You and I will watch them and think of
that, mother."</p>

<p>The neighbor woman turned on the lounge,
and they fell into silence again. The little girl
remained standing at a window, her face
pressed close to the glass.</p>

<p>As she waited there, the whole east began
gradually to spring into flame. The sky blazed
as ruddily as if a great fire were just beyond
the horizon and racing to leap it and sweep
across upon the farm. A broad fan of light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
roseate at its pivot and radiating in shafts of
yellow and red, was rising and paling the stars
with its shining edge. Wider and wider it
grew, until from north to south, and almost as
far up as the zenith, were thrust its shining
sticks. Then out of the cold mist floating over
the distant Sioux showed a copper segment
of the moon, which rose into sight and
careened slowly heavenward, lighting up the
wide plains, glimmering on the placid water of
the sloughs, and shining full into the face of
the dreaming little girl.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> the neighbor woman was at the farm-house
next day to comfort the little girl and
help her through the sad hours. There was no
sign of the pig-wagon all morning, and as the
afternoon passed slowly away the little girl
ceased to strain her eyes along the road leading
to the school-house, and never left her mother's
side. It was the neighbor woman who, not daring
to leave the room even to do the chores
about the barn and coops, looked south every
few moments with the hope that the biggest
brother would return before it was too late.</p>

<p>As the day drew toward its close the sun,
which had been lurking sulkily behind the
clouds, came out brightly and shone into the
sitting-room, where its beams lay across the
foot of the canopied bed like a warm coverlet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
The room was robbed of its gloom, and the little
girl's mother opened her eyes and looked
about her, long and thoughtfully, as one gazes
upon a loved scene that is drifting from sight.</p>

<p>The walls were hung with spatter-work that
the biggest brother had done, and with photographs
and magazine pictures in splint frames.
Over the front door was tacked the first yarn
motto that the little girl had ever worked. It
was faded, but her mother, though her eyes
were dimming, could read the uneven line:
"God Bless Our Home." The new cane-seated
chairs were set about against the walls, and a
bright blue cover hid the round, oak center-table.
The eldest brother's violin lay in its
case on the organ that had come into the house
the month before when the wheat was sold.
Up on the clock-shelf was a Dresden shepherd
in stately pose before his dainty shepherdess.
The curtains on the windows hung white and
soft to the carpet.</p>

<p>Presently the mother asked to be raised on
her pillow, and the neighbor woman and the
little girl turned the bed so that she could look
out of the windows at the setting sun.</p>

<p>The western heavens rioted in a fuller beauty
that afternoon than had the eastern half at
moon-rise the night before. As the sun sank
behind the clouds piled high upon the horizon,
it colored them in gorgeous array and threw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
them out in wonderful shapes and sharp relief
against a clearing sky. Castles towered on one
side, vast turrets standing forth above their
walls; on the other, banks of tinted vapor
formed a huge cloud-seat.</p>

<p>The little girl, calm, though her heart was
torn with pain, looked out with her mother
upon the dying glories. She had often before
in her life seen that changing panorama which,
thrown up one moment, melted into nothingness
the next. At night she had learned to
kneel with her face that way,&mdash;to the great billows
that always seemed to her a seat in the
sky, that were always something more than
mere vapor. She could pray better when, long
after sundown, they hung above the horizon,
robbed of their colors but still glorious. And
there had grown up in her mind the comforting
thought that on those very billows was
God's throne, and from them, at sunset, He
looked down upon that part of the earth that
was sinking into the night, and blessed it and
told it farewell. She even thought she could
see His face in the heavens sometimes,&mdash;His
flowing white robes, and the amethyst stool
upon which He rested his feet.</p>

<p>As the sun dropped behind the prairie, the
cloud-throne loomed forth against the blue
more vividly than ever. The little girl kept
her eyes dumbly upon it, watching the crimson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and gold slowly fade to royal purple where the
King sat.</p>

<p>"Remember what I said, pet lamb," her mother
whispered. She could not see, yet she was
still holding the little girl's hands firmly. "Remember
what I told you to do."</p>

<p>The little girl could not answer; she could
only bow her head in reply. Tearless, she
waited beside the bed, where, for the second
time, Life was striving with Death,&mdash;and was
to lose. There was no sound in the room until
there came a last whisper, "Pray."</p>

<p>The little girl slipped down from the edge of
the bed to the carpet and knelt toward the west.
A collie trotted up to her and licked her cheek.
She put him gently aside. She was trying to
think of something to say in behalf of her mother
to Him who, even now, was taking His
farewell look. At last a thought came to her,
and her lips moved to speak aloud the only petition
she could think of:</p>

<p>"O God," she pleaded, raising her eyes to
where the seat, marvelous in purple and burning
gold, loomed high over the prairie against
the sky, "please be good to my mother."</p>

<p>And as she knelt there, strong in her faith
and brave in her grief, a messenger came down
from the western cloud-throne&mdash;a messenger of
peace from the God of the little girl.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE LITTLE TEACHER</h3>


<div class='cap'>WITH one of the biggest brother's checked
jumpers pinned across her breast, and
with suds spattered up her bare arms to her
shoulders, the little girl was valiantly attacking
the weekly wash. A clothes-basket at her feet
was piled with white garments awaiting the
bluing. The tub was full of colored things
that were receiving a second rub. Out of doors,
on a line stretched between the corner of the
kitchen and the high seat of the big farm wagon,
flapped the drying sheets and pillow-cases.
Breakfast was cleared away, the beds were
made, the sitting-room was tidied, and it was
not eight o'clock, yet she was nearly done.
And while she worked steadily to finish, the
boiler on the stove behind her kept time with
its clanking cover to the grating tune of her
washboard.</div>

<p>The little girl no longer had to make use of
a three-legged milking-stool in order to reach
the tub. Instead, she stood square on the floor.
For she was tall for her scant fifteen years,
having grown so rapidly in the last twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
months that she now came up to the youngest
brother's chin, and required fully ten yards
of cloth for a dress. But she still wore her hair
down her back, and, as she bobbed over the
clothes to give them their added drubbing,
shiny strands shook themselves loose from their
curly, captive neighbors and waved damply
against her flushing cheeks, till she looked like
a gay yellow dandelion a-sway in a gusty wind.</p>

<p>When the last red shirt was wrung from the
water, she began to dip bucketfuls and empty
them on the sloping ground at the farther side
of the storm-cellar, singing blithely as she hurried
back and forth. She was so intent on her
carrying that she did not see a horseman who
was turning in at the ash lane, his face eagerly
lifted to the windows of the farm-house. Even
when, having tied his mount at the block in
front, he rapped on the sitting-room door, she
did not hear him. Finally, when, receiving
no answer, he walked around the corner to the
entry, she stepped out with her last pail and
came face to face with him.</p>

<p>Joy leaped into his eyes as he dropped his
whip and lifted his hat; something more than
surprise lighted hers as she let her suds fall
and spill over the stone step. Then, stammering
a welcome, she surrendered her hands
to the glad grasp of the colonel's son.</p>

<p>"My! it's good to see you!" he cried, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
at her with the old frankness. He stepped
back a little to measure her from top to toe.
"And <i>haven't</i> you shot up!"</p>

<p>"Like a ragweed," she laughed, taking him
into the kitchen, where she brought him a chair
from the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"You're a full-fledged housekeeper, too,"
he declared. "How do you like the change
from herding?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't herded much for a long
while," she replied proudly, as she refilled her
tub from a barrel in the corner that had been
drawn by the biggest brother; "I helped
mother in the house all last summer." She
grew sober suddenly, and the colonel's son hastened
to change the subject.</p>

<p>"You're looking awfully well," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"I've worn off some of my tan," she explained.</p>

<p>"Well, that's partly it," he said, and his
glance was boyishly eloquent.</p>

<p>She fell to rubbing again, and he watched
her admiringly, noticing how trim was her black
dress, and how spotless were the lace at her
throat and the ribbon that bound back her hair.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you can guess where I'm
started for," he said, after a moment of silence.</p>

<p>She straightened up to rest her back and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
looked out through an open window. "I
thought you were just coming here."</p>

<p>"No." He watched her for a sign of pleased
astonishment when he continued, "I'm on my
way to St. Paul."</p>

<p>She turned swiftly, her eyes open wide.
"College?" she questioned in a low, strained
voice.</p>

<p>"Nearly that; I shall prepare for West
Point. The bishop has chosen a school for
me."</p>

<p>Her eyes went back to the window, but a
mist was over them now, and she could not
see the square of cottonwoods and barley
framed by the sash.</p>

<p>"I left the Wyoming post a week ago," he
went on. "Father's orderly brought my trunk
to Chamberlain, and I rode down from there
to the reservation&mdash;and then came here. I
shall take the train at the station. It's changed
to morning time, I believe, and goes by about
10:30."</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear him. Her face was
still turned away, and she was murmuring to
herself. "The bishop!" she repeated; "the
bishop!" All at once she ran out of the room.
When she returned, she held a tin spice-box in
her hand. She took a letter from it and held
it toward the colonel's son. "Read this," she
said. "It's from the bishop to mother."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>He spread out the written sheet, which was
dated two years back, and read it aloud.</p>

<p>"'Whenever that spirited little maid of
yours is ready to take up the studies she cannot
enjoy where you are, send her to me. I will
get her ready for the college she dreams about,
and, if God takes you from her soon, as you
fear, and as I pray not (though His will be
done!), I will watch over her like a father.'"</p>

<p>When he finished, he looked up at her, his
face fairly sparkling. "Of course you'll go,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No," she answered sadly, shaking her
head; "I can't go. I haven't any money.
The boys have just bought some land that joins
ours. If I left, they'd have to pay my expenses
and then hire some one to take my
place. So they wouldn't be able to pay for
the land. I shall have to wait till I can earn
something myself."</p>

<p>"It's a shame!" declared the colonel's son.
"Because if you work here, how can you
earn anything?"</p>

<p>She shook her head again. "I don't know.
Only I <i>shall</i> go some day. I'm&mdash;I'm glad
<i>you're</i> going, though."</p>

<p>"But it's been more your hope than mine.
I'm sorry it isn't different&mdash;that we aren't
just changed around. I don't care to study
much, anyway. I want to be a soldier, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
father. I don't see why I should study so much
for that. I've been everywhere with him
after Indians. I wish I could go on at it without
stopping to study."</p>

<p>"I don't know what <i>I</i> want to be. I only
know that I love to read and study. If I could
read and study I wouldn't mind living on the
plains."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't?" cried the colonel's son.
"Why, maybe I shall always have to live here,
and&mdash;" He stopped in confusion, and got up
hastily, hat in hand. "Good-by," he said.
He stepped toward her, his head lowered bashfully.
She wiped her hands on the jumper.</p>

<p>"Do you have to go?" she asked. "Can't
you stay and have dinner? My brothers would
love to see you. And I'd cook you something
nice."</p>

<p>"No," he replied, a little agitated. "I won't
more than catch my train." He shook hands
and started out. At the door he glanced back,
and was startled at her colorless face. "What
is it?" he pleaded, coming back to her side.</p>

<p>She sat down on a bench by the window, the
jumper crushed in her fingers. "Oh, I want
to go! I want to go!" she said, her voice deep
with pain and longing. "I'm lonesome here.
I miss mother terribly. I'm always listening
for her; I'm always getting up and going into
the next room as if she were there. And then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I remember&mdash;" She broke down and wept, all
her pride gone.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't," whispered the colonel's son,
tenderly. "It'll all come out right. Next
year, when I'm on my way back, I'll stop, and
we'll talk it over again. That won't be long.
Maybe something will turn up, too, between
now and then."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said hopelessly. But she
checked her tears and rose to follow him out.
At the mounting-block they shook hands again.
Then he sprang into the saddle and galloped
through the yard toward the north.</p>

<p>"A year isn't long," she whispered to herself,
as she watched him disappear in the corn,
and she went bravely back to her tub.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">A month</span> went by,&mdash;a month of dull routine
that was enlivened only by the harvesters. Day
after day she plodded through a heavy program
of breakfast, dinner, supper, bed-making,
sweeping, and the care of the chickens and pigs;
her calendar was the added duties that each
morning entailed of washing, ironing, mending,
scrubbing, and baking. The promise of the
colonel's son came to cheer her sometimes; but
it was a peep into the tin spice-box each evening
that heartened her most. For to her the
bishop's letter was the single link between the
prairie and the longed-for campus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Then one afternoon, as she sat churning, the
dasher in one hand, in the other a spoon that
busily returned the cream frothing from the
hole of the cover, there came a second tap at
the front door. This time she heard, and ran
through the sitting-room, still grasping the
spoon, to invite the new settler to enter.</p>

<p>He tramped in with a jocund greeting, sat
down on the kitchen floor in a path of sunlight,
and leaned against the wall, smoking. "Go
right on&mdash;go right on," he urged. "Like to see
you trouncing the cream. And what I've got
to say won't sour it."</p>

<p>She went on with her butter-making, the
tall, wooden vessel firmly held between her feet.</p>

<p>"Had a meeting of the school committee yesterday,"
he began, puffing at his pipe slowly.
"We talked over hunting up another teacher
to take the place of the one the Dutchman
hired."</p>

<p>"She isn't coming?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"No, she isn't coming; she's going to take
a school near Sioux Falls," he answered
crossly. "I'm tired of these teachers that
pretend to the little schools away off nowhere
that they're ready to take them, when all the
while they've got their eyes peeled for a school
near town. So I've proposed to the committee
that we get some one about here to take the
school&mdash;some one that won't fail us, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
can handle my young ones, the two little chaps
from the West Fork, and one or two of the
Dutchman's. That's about all the scholars
there'll be this term. What do you think about
it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I should think it would be all right," she
faltered, churning so hard that the froth
climbed up the dasher, carrying pieces of fresh
butter with it and leaving them midway on the
handle.</p>

<p>"I should think so, too," said the new settler;
"and that's about the way we fixed it
up. And&mdash;well, we thought we'd offer it to
you."</p>

<p>She got up, her color coming and going
swiftly, and stood before him. "To <i>me</i>?" she
asked. "Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>He assented by a nod.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's too good to be true," she went
on. "I can hardly believe it." She began to
laugh tearfully. "You see, I've&mdash;I've&mdash;" Then,
at sight of the braid lying over her shoulder,
she put up her hands and gathered her
hair into a knot. "I'll take it," she said.</p>

<p>"Glad of that," answered the new settler,
cheerily, and, with a glance at the handle of the
dasher, "I think that butter's come."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was just a week later when she rode south
and took charge of the school. The day was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
full of joy and misgivings. She was happy
when, with one of the new settler's babies before
the chart, she could point out the very
lines the Yankton man had shown her, and hear
the little one striving to lisp and learn them.
She was filled with doubts when, having dismissed
a class, the pupils looked back at her
from their seats, some mockingly, she thought,
others with laughing eyes that challenged hers.
But at four o'clock, when, at the tap of the
hand-bell, they cleared their desks and sat
straight with folded arms, they seemed to have
gotten over the novelty of her supervision, and
marched out, with good-bys as they passed
the teacher's table, just as they had in former
terms. She rode home, feeling that her work
was well begun.</p>

<p>The first six weeks of the term passed without
incident. There had sprung up a complete
understanding between her and the children,
and her affection for them was returned with
gratifying respect. Then, one Monday morning,
there entered a disturbing element.</p>

<p>A Polish woman, whose husband had moved
his family down from Pierre to occupy the
Irishman's shack, came to the school, bringing
her son, a gawky, hangdog lad of twelve. While
she recited a long account of his past experiences
with teachers, and dictated her wishes as
to his treatment by the little girl, he acted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
interpreter. When she finally departed, with
admonitions and sidewise wags of the head, he
shuffled defiantly to a desk.</p>

<p>He occupied his first hour in slyly flipping
wet-paper wads at a picture of Shakspere
pinned above him on the wall. The little girl,
who was well versed in all school tricks from
her years of sitting in a rear seat, knew what he
was doing, but hesitated to speak to him. At
last, seeing that he was attracting the attention
of all the other children, she sent him to the
blackboard to copy his spelling ten times.</p>

<p>By ingenious counting he soon completed
his work, and then began to draw pipe-stem
men for the Dutchman's youngest to giggle at.
He was sent back to his desk, where he spent
the time in wriggling his ears.</p>

<p>The little girl saw that trouble was before
her,&mdash;saw, too, that her position would be imperiled
if she failed in her discipline. That
night, when the biggest brother helped her to
get supper and make the beds, she shared her
fears with him.</p>

<p>"It's one thing to get a school," she said
sorrowfully, as he tried to comfort her; "it's
another to keep it."</p>

<p>But next day she called the pupils to order
cheerfully.</p>

<p>It was evident that the young Pole had been
well discussed by the children. They watched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
him constantly to see what new prank he was
preparing for their entertainment. He swaggered
under their astonished gaze, and insolently
made requests aloud without raising his
hand for permission to speak. Just before
recess, upon chancing to glance his way, the little
girl caught him tossing a note over to the
other side of the room.</p>

<p>She suddenly came to a halt beside his desk,
and anger, strange and almost unreasonable,
possessed her. It flashed into her mind that before
her, ignorant, slouchy, indifferent, was
one who, by his mischief, threatened to deprive
her of what her mother and the biggest brother
had long desired, what she herself yearned
after with all the earnestness of her soul.
She could scarcely refrain from attempting to
send him off then and there! She trembled
with indignation. Meeting her eyes for a moment,
he saw a dangerous glint in them, and
for the rest of the morning was more circumspect.</p>

<p>But at noon, a full dinner, a lazy hour, and
the ill-concealed admiration of the other children
put him again into a mean mood. He
got out of line in marching, and pulled the
hair of one of the little fellows from the West
Fork. The little girl passed the afternoon with
her eyes upon him. When he went so far that
the school was interrupted, she walked toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
him and gave him some task, or stayed beside
his desk while she was hearing a class. But
though in a measure it kept him in subjection,
her power over the others, she found, was being
woefully lessened, and her discipline destroyed.
At dismissal she took up her hat and
pail with a weariness that was not physical, but
of the spirit, and rode home, bowed and silent.</p>

<p>But, unknown to her, the Polish boy defeated
his own evil ends that same evening, and solved
to her satisfaction, and to that of the committee
and the scholars, the question of her
rule.</p>

<p>He was sent to the Swede's to inquire after a
turkey that his mother thought had strayed up
the river and nested near the reservation road;
and, in asking after the hen, he departed from
his errand long enough to boast to the Swede
boy of his fun at the school-house. The latter
listened to him eagerly, though quietly, grinned
slyly once or twice during the story, and at the
close of it remarked, with his finger on his
nose, that he thought he had better go back
to school again himself.</p>

<p>The following morning, when she entered,
to her surprise, the little girl found him seated
in the back of the room, his lunch in a newspaper
beside him, his books in a strap at his
feet. "Ay kome tow lairn again," he said,
and then waited until she assigned him a desk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>He was so interested in the little girl that,
for the first hour after school was called, he
forgot to watch the young Pole. Everywhere
she moved, he kept his eyes upon her. If she
caught his glance, she saw in it only pride and
encouragement and was content.</p>

<p>But the young Pole, seeing that the Swede
boy did not look at him, became piqued at
last and set about gaining not only the attention
of the new pupil, but of the entire school.
He rummaged his pockets for a bean-shooter,
and, finding one, proceeded to let the dry beans
fly, snapping them loudly against the benches.</p>

<p>The anger, resentment, and mortification on
the little girl's face at his audacity made the
Swede boy squirm in his seat. But he said
nothing, seemed not to watch the bean-shooting,
and bided his time.</p>

<p>At last, interrupted in her teaching and
goaded to the point of rebuke, the little girl
dismissed a class and, rising in her chair,
called the school to attention. "I am sorry to
have to speak to any one before the rest," she
said, her face white, her voice almost gone with
excitement; "but I must have order." She
looked straight at the young Pole.</p>

<p>He scraped his feet and smirked at her, at the
same time flipping a bean from between his
thumb and finger. It struck the stove with a
sharp ring that brought the Swede boy to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
feet. His hand was raised to attract her attention.
She nodded.</p>

<p>The Swede boy lowered his arm very slowly,
looking about him with an air of deprecation.
"Ay doan know," he said in a low voice, "eef
yo theenk like me. Bote she"&mdash;he pointed to
the little girl&mdash;"komes, takes th' skole, lairns
us. We bay gote to pay hair back." He shifted
till he stood over the young Pole. "So eef
somebodey no bay gote," he added, with a
threatening note in his voice, <i>"ay make hame</i>."
Then he sank to his seat again, having for the
second time in that school-room saved her from
bitter humiliation.</p>

<p>The next morning the school-house withstood
its last throe. At ten o'clock, in the midst
of a reading-lesson, there entered the young
Pole's father. His ox-gad was in his hand;
he did not remove his hat, but strode forward
to the teacher's desk, sputtering broken English.
When he came near, he shook his empty
fist so close to the little girl that she caught the
scent of hay on it, for he had been throwing
down feed to his cattle.</p>

<p>"No touch my flesh unt blut," he cried savagely;
"no touch my flesh unt blut."</p>

<p>A half-recumbent figure in the rear, whose
pale eyes rested upon her, gave the little girl
courage. "No one has been touched," she
replied. "But if the school is made noisy by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
a pupil, then that pupil will be punished, or will
leave."</p>

<p>The Pole raised his gad with a grunt of rage.
"Eh?" he shouted, cursing in his own tongue.
He nourished his arms and stamped up and
down wildly. Of a sudden he saw the Swede
boy, who had come forward and halted beside
the table. His gaze fell before the pale, half-shut
eyes, his voice lowered, and he ceased to
swing his whip and swear. Then he hedged
adroitly, speaking in broken English again and
giving quick looks at the Swede boy's huge, red
hands, that hung, clenched and twitching, on
either side of his stalwart person.</p>

<p>"I hav-v no trouble wid you," he said to
the little girl, his manner changing to one of
apology, "bud I lick my boy mineself," and he
moved down the aisle and disappeared through
the door.</p>

<p>His son gazed after him in amazement and
disgust, gave a sniff of contempt, and replied
to the triumphant look on the little girl's face
by extracting his geography and going to work.
He played his pranks no more, and the term
passed peaceably, under the mental guidance
of the little girl and the physical overlordship
of the Swede boy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of the last day of school, when
her pupils had said their good-bys and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
straying homeward laden with their books and
slates, the little girl stayed behind. And, sitting
in the very place to which in former years
she had raised reverent eyes, she looked round
the building, every crack and corner of which
had its memory.</p>

<p>On the bench by the door, close beside the
leaky water-bucket, was the same battered,
greasy basin in which the neighbor woman's
daughter had placed a horse-hair one day,
stoutly maintaining that in due time the hair
would miraculously turn into a worm.</p>

<p>The broken pointer reminded her of a certain
fierce encounter when, having confided to one
of the Dutchman's seven that on the previous
Sunday the farm-house had partaken of a dish
of canned frogs' legs, she had been hailed in return
as "Miss Chinaman," and the teacher had
closed the event by routing her tormentors.</p>

<p>She thought of the morning the Dutch children
first came in leather shoes, an occasion
recalled by the pencil-marks behind the chart,
where she had stood her punishment for too
much smiling.</p>

<p>The stove-poker brought back the terrible
moment she had dared to put her tongue
against it in the icy school-room, and had had
to sit with the iron cleaving to her until the
teacher warmed some water.</p>

<p>The peg above the coal-bins reminded her of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the winter day when she took down the well-rope
and tied it to the faithful Luffree's collar,
so that, with his keener, finer instinct for direction,
he could lead teacher and pupils through
a blizzard to the safety of the farm-house.</p>

<p>She was suddenly awakened from her day-dreams
by the sound of galloping. A horseman
was approaching from the direction of the
farm-house, and she hurried to the door to see
who it could be. As he came near, she ran out
joyfully to meet him. It was the colonel's son.</p>

<p>"They told me you were here," he cried,
springing from his saddle. She could scarcely
answer him for sheer happiness, and when he
brought out her mount and they started away
through the twilight, he leading the horses, she
walked beside him silently.</p>

<p>He told her about his trip, his months at the
preparatory school, his new friends, the wonders
of the big city in which he had been living,
hardly taking a breath in his excitement as his
narrative swept along. Suddenly he became
quiet and bent toward her anxiously, penitently.</p>

<p>"Go on," she urged; "it's fine!"</p>

<p>"But I've forgotten to ask you how you've
been and what you've been doing. Or whether&mdash;next
year&mdash;Of course I wish awfully that
you could&mdash;"</p>

<p>He faltered, stopped. Then, after a moment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
"But you're as brave as can be to just go
right on at this school and let your teacher help
you all she can. It'll all count, you'll find,
when you start in studying some place else."</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "You haven't heard,"
she said. Even in the dusk he could see that her
face was beaming.</p>

<p>"Heard what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That I've been going to school, but&mdash;not
in the way you think."</p>

<p>He halted in the road. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I've been teaching."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a long way from the school to the farm-house,
yet the colonel's son and the little girl
had so much to tell each other that they were
not done even when the lane was reached. So
they paused in its gloom, under the budding
ash-boughs. A red-breasted thrush, just returned
to his old haunts, twittered inquiringly
at them from a twig above, and the horses
nickered and champed on their bits. But they
heard only each other until, having lighted the
lamp in the sitting-room, the biggest brother
strolled toward them, singing a gay love-song.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<h3>TOWARD THE RISING SUN</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE big brothers sat in a sullen circle about
the sitting-room table, the eldest smoking,
the biggest studying his fingers, the youngest
whittling jackstraws. Near, silent and
troubled, hovered the little girl, watching the
three who, like the Fates themselves, seemed to
be settling her destiny.</div>

<p>"So you don't want her to go," said the
biggest, taking up the discussion where it had
been dropped a few moments before; "though
you know it was mother's last wish, an' that
the youngster's always wanted it. Well, your
reasons; let's hear 'em again from first to
last."</p>

<p>"What'll she do with all this eddication
she's hankerin' for?" demanded the eldest,
flashing angry eyes around. "Tell me that."</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted the biggest, and he threw
back his head with a hearty laugh. "Well!
well!" he exclaimed, when he could speak;
"<i>that's</i> what's worrying you, is it! Jus' let
me ask <i>you</i> something. Did you ever hear of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
anybody in your life that had an eddication
fastened on to 'em an' didn't know what t'
do with it? What'll <i>she</i> do with it? Wait
till she's <i>got</i> it. Then she an' me'll sit down
an' tell you a-a-all about it."</p>

<p>There was a note of ridicule in his voice that
fired the eldest, who made no reply, but struck
the wooden bowl of his pipe so savagely against
his boot-heel that it split and fell from its stem.
Then he turned upon the youngest with a wave
of the hand that commanded an opinion.</p>

<p>"Yes, what've <i>you</i> got to say?" inquired
the biggest, also turning.</p>

<p>The youngest shrugged his shoulders. "You
two run the business to suit yourselves," he
said; "I wash my hands of it." He began another
jackstraw without glancing up.</p>

<p>"That's good," said the biggest; "that
counts you out." He tilted his chair around
until he faced the eldest. "I'm no dog in the
manger," he continued; "I didn't have a
chance to learn more than the law allows, or
to go to a city school. But I wanted to, bad
enough. That's why I know how <i>she</i> feels."
He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the
little girl. "I'm for her goin'; an', whatever
comes of it, I'll stand by her. Books is all she
wants&mdash;let her have 'em. We ain't got no
right to hold her back."</p>

<p>"She can have 'em here," interposed the
eldest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, along with work that's too hard on
her. You wouldn't think of puttin' a fine animal
like the blue mare on the plow; no, of
course you wouldn't. There's some horses
born for teamin' an' some for high-toned
carriage pullin'. It happens in this case we
ain't talkin' about a draft plug." He was
trembling in his earnestness. After a pause
he went on. "She might stay here. That's
right. But she'd never have a cent to call her
own 'less she earned it teachin'. Some way or
other, the boys in a family always think they
own the farm; girls ain't got no share, no matter
how hard they've drudged around the kitchen
or the garden, or even in the fields. They
can take anything that's given 'em till they
marry; or they can hang around an' play nurse-girl
an' kitchen-girl to their brothers' wives."</p>

<p>"I've always noticed," broke in the eldest,
changing his ground, and ignoring what the
biggest said, "that every country girl who goes
to town polishes herself up like a milk-pan till
she's worn off the prairie look, an' then she
marries some dude with a head like an addled
egg."</p>

<p>The biggest threw the little girl a swift,
roguish glance. "I ain't afraid of the dude
part of it," he said; "I'm willin' to trust her
taste, anyway. I don't have to live with him;
neither do you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," asked the eldest, giving
the table a blow with his fist, "that you
think a city's the place for a girl, friends or no
friends? Nobody's goin' to look after her,
when she leaves here, as careful as we do."</p>

<p>"The bishop," suggested the little girl, advancing
almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"The bishop!" sneered the youngest.</p>

<p>"I thought you washed your hands of this,"
reminded the biggest, with a look that instantly
quieted the youngest; "I guess maybe
you didn't get 'em clean. At any rate, you'd
better jus' make jackstraws." He faced the
eldest again.</p>

<p>"I say the city's no place for her," the
latter continued hotly. He pointed through the
open door to where, above the ash-trees, a
hawk was pursuing a field-sparrow that vainly,
by sudden dips and rises, strove to escape its
enemy. "You see that?" he cried. "Well, in
every city there's a thousand hawks with their
claws out waiting to swoop down on them that
don't watch. She'd better not go, I say.
She'll be safe and happy here. It was so long
since mother'd seen a big place she forgot how
it is there. It's not too late to stop gettin'
ready. You'd better stay." He stood up and
whirled about upon the little girl.</p>

<p>The biggest brother gave a dissenting shake
of the head. "She'll be safe enough," he
said. "It's only when a little bird gets careless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that the hawk gets him. What do <i>you</i>
know about a city, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"The hardware man says&mdash;" began the eldest.</p>

<p>The biggest cut him short. "There's some
people in this world that can't do a lick of
good," he said, "but they can do any amount
of mischief. That hardware man's one of
'em."</p>

<p>"She ain't got enough money to last her
more 'n six months," the eldest asserted, once
more changing ground.</p>

<p>"I've got what I've just made teaching,"
said the little girl.</p>

<p>The biggest shook a warning finger at her.
"I'm runnin' this parley-voo," he laughed.
Then he became serious again. "She's got
what she's jus' made teachin'," he agreed.
"Well, that won't last her long. So&mdash;" He
hesitated, arose, and began to walk the floor
nervously. "Course," he faltered, "I bought
that quarter-section from the Swede. But I
don't need it more 'n a cat needs two tails.
Jus' bought it to be a-doin'. So&mdash;I've concluded
to call the bargain off, and buy some
land later on. The&mdash;the&mdash;youngster can have
the little pile I've got."</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Then the little
girl put out her arms, and the biggest brother
drew her to him. "That's the way we've settled
it," he said. His voice was husky, his eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
overflowing. "I want to help her get away.
An'&mdash;an'&mdash;Heaven knows how I am going to
miss her. You two'll not feel it as I will." He
buried his face in her shoulder. Finally he
spoke again. "Next year, when her money
runs out, she'll have my share of the crop and
herd; an' <i>every</i> year she'll have my share till
she's through an' ready to do something for
herself. Then I'll buy that quarter-section.
It belongs to the Swede boy. He'll keep
it to sell it to me any time in the next ten years.
He says so; that's <i>his</i> part toward helpin'
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear old brother," whispered the little
girl, "thank you! thank you!" She was dangerously
near to tears and could say no more.</p>

<p>"We've decided," said the biggest, "that
we might as well get this thing over. So&mdash;so&mdash;she's
goin' to-day."</p>

<p>"To-day?" The eldest and the youngest
almost shouted in their surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-day," repeated the biggest. "She's
goin' to do a little studyin' this summer; now,
I'm goin' to hitch up," he added, as he kissed
the little girl and went out.</p>

<p>The eldest and the youngest remained beside
the table, the former battling with disappointment
and sorrow, the latter suddenly wrathful
and concerned. As they sat there, the little
girl packed a few last garments into a leather
satchel and put on her hat and coat. Then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
climbed the stairs to the attic to tell the low,
bare room good-by.</p>

<p>Ever afterward, when she thought of the
farm-house, it was the attic that first pictured
itself in her mind, for the rooms below had seen
many improvements since her birth-night over
fifteen years before, but the attic had remained
unchanged. Above the litter of barrels and
boxes that covered the western half of the floor,
hung the Christmas trimmings in their little
bag; seeds for the spring planting, each kind
done up separately; strings of dried peppers;
rows of cob-corn, suspended by the shucks;
slippery-elm, sage, and boneset in paper packages;
unused powder-horns; and the big brothers'
steel traps. To the east of the stovepipe
were their beds, covered with patchwork quilts
made by the mother, and the boxes in which
they kept their clothes and trinkets.</p>

<p>The little girl halted sadly beneath the slanting
rafters to look round. When she finally
turned away to descend, she had to feel her way
carefully, though the morning sun, but lately
risen, was pouring in its light.</p>

<p>The farewells in the sitting-room were soon
over. With many a promise to write, with
fond pats to the dogs that crowded about her
hoping she would take them on her drive, with
tender kisses on the pillows of the old canopied
bed, and glances behind, she went out into the
frosty air and took her seat in the buckboard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Her face was calm and her eyes were dry as
they drove out of the yard. She was bravely
fighting down her grief at leaving, and she
looked back again and again to wave her hand
to the eldest and the youngest, who were standing
outside the kitchen, swinging their hats in
tardily repentant and approving response.</p>

<p>At sight of the carnelian bluff, she suddenly
sat very still, and a pang shot through her
heart. Looking down at the well-worn, weed-bordered
road, she remembered the November
morning when, with even deeper sorrow, she
walked behind her who was never to pass
through the corn again.</p>

<p>Opposite the bluff the biggest brother
stopped the buckboard and the little girl
stepped down, crossed the half-thawed drifts
that still lay on the western slope, and went up
to the graves. A brisk wind was blowing over
the plains and shaking the scent from the first
wild prairie-violets that dotted the new grass.</p>

<p>She paused but a moment at the pipestone
cross, but beside the other grave she knelt and
looked long and lovingly at the white headboard.
The chaplain had put it up the day
after the funeral, and had lettered on it in
black:</p>

<div class='center'>
MOTHER<br />
"Blessed are the pure in heart."<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later she joined the biggest
brother, and the buckboard hurried on. She
did not look around at the house or bluff until
the highest point between the track and the
farm was reached. Then, as if he read her
wish, the biggest brother again drew rein.</p>

<p>She stood up to look back. She could see the
herd, peacefully trailing across the river meadows
in search of green feeding. Beyond lay
the awakening fields under the cold sun, the
bluff, the house shining in a new coat of red,
the board barn towering over the low sod one
at its back. And she caught a glimpse of the
two dark figures still standing against the
kitchen, watching her out of sight. She did not
see a third, whose pale eyes were so dim that he
in turn could not see her as he loitered mournfully
by the side of a stack.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said softly; "good-by." A
sob came from her biggest brother. She sank
to the seat and, putting her arms about his
neck, clung to him, weeping aloud.</p>

<p>As they drove on, he manfully strove to restrain
his grief. When he turned east at the
railroad, he drew his sleeve across his eyes and
clucked to the horse.</p>

<p>"It'd be a lot worse if you had to stay,"
he said. "There's everything before you
where you're goin', if you want to work
for it. Here there's nothing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl lifted her head from his shoulder
with fresh courage. "I know it," she said.
She gave him a grateful smile, and turned to
look back once more.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry parted her lips. She pointed
off beyond the farm-house. "See!" she exclaimed,
and the biggest brother brought the
horse to a stand.</p>

<p>Hanging against the sky was a spectral
city whose buildings, inverted and magnified,
loomed through the clear, crisp air in marble-like
grandeur, and whose spires, keen-tipped
and transparent, were thrust far down toward
the earth.</p>

<p>Breathlessly the little girl watched the mirage,
which to her seemed divine, as if He who
sat at sunset upon the throne of clouds were
showing her the longed-for city of her dreams
in a celestial image, high and white and beautiful.
Joy shone on her face at the wonderful
thought; and into her eyes there came a light of
comprehension, of determination, and of enduring
hope,&mdash;it was the radiant light of womanhood.
And the biggest brother, looking proudly
at her, knew at that moment that she was no
longer a little girl.</p>
